  <h2 id='OT' class='c006'><a href='#TOC'>THE OLD TESTAMENT</a></h2>
</div>

<h3 id='OT1' class='c007'><a href='#TOC-OT'>1. The Creation</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth. And the earth was waste and void; and darkness
was upon the deep. And the Spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters. And God said: Let there
be light&#8212;and there was light. And there was evening
and there was morning, the first day.&#8212;And God made
a vast expanse which he called Heaven. And there
was evening and there was morning, a second day.&#8212;And
God gathered the waters into one place, and the
dry land appeared. And God said: Let the earth put
forth grass and herbs and trees bearing fruit. And
there was evening and there was morning, a third day.&#8212;And
God made the two great lights, the greater
light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the
night. He made the stars also. And there was evening
and there was morning, a fourth day.&#8212;And God
created the great sea-monsters, and every creature
that lives in the waters, and every fowl that flies under
heaven. And there was evening and there was morning,
a fifth day.&#8212;And God made the beasts of the
earth, and the cattle, and everything that creeps upon
the ground. And God said: Let us make man in our
image, and let them have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over
everything that lives upon the earth. And God created
man in His own image, in the image of God created
He him; male and female created He them.</p>

<p class='c009'>And God saw everything that He had made, and
behold, it was very good. And there was evening and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>there was morning, a sixth day. And God rested on
the seventh day from all His work, and He blessed
the seventh day and hallowed it. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 1.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT2' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>2. Adam and Eve</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>God planted a garden eastward, in Eden. This
garden has been called Paradise. And out of the
ground God made to grow every tree that is pleasant
to the sight; the tree of life also in the midst of the
garden; and the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil. And God put man in the garden of Eden to
dress it and to keep it, and He said: Of every tree of
the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of
knowledge thou shalt not eat; for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&#8212;God said also:
It is not good that the man should be alone; I will
make him a help, answering to him. And God
brought all living creatures to Adam to see what he
would call them, and whatsoever Adam called every
creature, that was the name thereof; but for man there
was not found a help meet for him. And God caused
a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and He took one of
his ribs and made thereof a woman and brought her
unto him. Then Adam said: This is now bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called
Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore
shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.&#8212;Adam
was the first man, and Eve was the first
woman.&#8212;They were innocent, and knew neither sin,
nor sorrow, nor sickness, nor death. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 2.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT3' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>3. The Fall</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The serpent was more cunning than any beast of
the field which God had made. And he said unto the
woman: Has God truly said: Ye shall not eat of any
tree in the garden? The woman answered: Of all the
other trees we may freely eat; but of the tree of
knowledge God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, lest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>ye die. The serpent answered: Ye shall not die; for
God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, your
eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing
good and evil. When the woman saw that the tree
was good for food, and that it was a delight to the
eyes, and desirable to make one wise, she took of the
fruit and ate, and she gave also to her husband, and
he ate. Then their eyes were opened, and they knew
that they were naked. In the evening they heard the
voice of God, and hid themselves among the trees of
the garden. Then God called unto Adam and said:
Where art thou? And Adam said: I heard Thy voice,
and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
Then God said: Who told thee that thou wast
naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of knowledge?
Adam answered: The woman gave me of the fruit, and
I ate. Then God said to the woman: What is this
thou hast done? She answered: The serpent beguiled
me, and I ate. And God said unto the serpent:
Cursed art thou above every beast of the field; upon
thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all
the days of thy life. I will put enmity between thee
and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed:
he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
heel.&#8212;Unto the woman God said: In pain thou shalt
bring forth children; and thy husband shall rule over
thee.&#8212;Unto the man God said: Cursed is the ground
for thy sake; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
thy bread, till thou return unto the ground; for dust
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. So God
drove Adam and Eve out of the garden of Eden, and
He placed Cherubim with a flaming sword to keep
the way to the tree of life.&#8212;Thus sin came into the
world, and through sin came sorrow and sickness and
death. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 3.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT4' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>4. Cain and Abel</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Adam and Eve got two sons; the first was called
Cain and the second Abel. Cain tilled the ground, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Abel kept sheep. Once they both brought their offerings
to the Lord: Cain brought of the fruit of the
ground, and Abel of the best of his flock. God had
respect unto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and
his offering He had not respect. Then Cain was very
wroth, and his countenance fell. And God said unto
him: Why is thy countenance fallen? Is it not so
that if thou doest well, thou mayst freely look up?
And if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door,
and its desire shall be unto thee, but do thou rule
over it. Still Cain rose up against Abel his brother
and slew him, when they were in the field. And the
Lord asked Cain: Where is thy brother? Cain answered:
I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?
Then the Lord said: Thy brother’s blood crieth unto
me from the ground. Therefore cursed art thou; and
a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.
And Cain went and dwelt on the east of Eden. His
descendants were inventive and skilful, they invented
harps and flutes and forged weapons; but they did
also that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
(Gen. 4.)</p>

<h3 id='OT5' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>5. Seth and His Descendants</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Adam and Eve got a son instead of Abel. He was
called Seth. Seth and his descendants were pious
and were called the children of God; but they were
not innocent; for all have sinned in Adam. One of
them was called Enoch; he walked with God and did
not die; the Lord took him, when he was 365 years
old. Methuselah lived 969 years, and is the oldest
of all men. His grandson was Noah. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 5.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT6' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>6. The Flood</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Men multiplied on the earth, and the sons of Seth
mingled with the descendants of Cain and took
their daughters for wives. Thereby wickedness became
great over all the earth, and it repented God
that he had made man. But Noah found favor in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>eyes of God. Therefore He said to Noah: Make thee
an ark, three hundred cubits<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> long, fifty cubits wide
and thirty cubits high, and pitch it within and without
with pitch; for I will bring a flood of waters upon the
earth to destroy everything that lives. Noah built the
ship which is called the ark, and went into it with his
wife and his three sons, Shem, Ham and Japhet, and
their wives, and a male and a female of all the animals
that cannot live in the water. Then God let it rain for
40 days and 40 nights, and the waters rose 15 cubits
over the highest mountains. And every living thing
was destroyed upon the earth. Noah only, and those
that were with him in the ark, were left alive.</p>

<p class='c009'>God remembered Noah and caused a wind to pass
over the earth, and the waters sank, and the ark
rested upon the mountains of Ararat. Noah opened
the window, and he sent forth a raven, and it went
forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from
off the earth. Then he sent forth a dove, but as she
found no rest for her foot, she returned to the ark, and
Noah put forth his hand and took her unto him. And
he stayed yet seven days, and he sent forth the dove
again. And she came back to him again at eventide,
and in her mouth she had a fresh olive leaf. And he
stayed yet seven days and sent forth the dove again,
and she returned not; then Noah knew that the earth
must be dry. The waters had then covered the earth
for more than one year.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Noah went out of the ark and made a thank
offering unto the Lord. And the Lord said in His
heart: I will not again curse the ground for man’s
sake, for man is evil from his youth. While the earth
remaineth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer
and winter, day and night shall not cease. And
God set the rainbow in the heavens as a token that
He would remember His covenant. Noah lived till
he was 950 years old, and is the second father of the
human race. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 6-9.)</span></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h3 id='OT7' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>7. The Tower of Babel</a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The whole earth was of one speech. When men
journeyed eastward, they found a large plain, and they
dwelt there. And they said one to another: Come, let
us build a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven,
lest we be scattered over the whole earth. But the
Lord came down and confounded their language, so
the one did not understand the other. Thus the Lord
scattered them over all the earth, and they left off
building. Therefore the place is called Babel, that is,
Confusion.&#8212;The descendants of Shem remained in
Asia, the descendants of Ham went southwest to
Africa, and the descendants of Japhet went westward
to Europe. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 11:1-9.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT8' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>8. Abraham Journeys to Canaan</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Terah descended from Shem. He dwelt in Mesopotamia
and had three sons, Abraham, Nahor and
Haran. Terah served strange gods. And the Lord
said unto Abraham: Get thee out of thy country, and
from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto
the land that I will show thee. I will make of thee a
great nation, and in thee shall all the families of the
earth be blessed. So Abraham took Sarah, his wife,
and his brother’s son Lot, and all that he had, and
went to the land of Canaan. And the Lord appeared
unto Abraham and said: Unto thy seed will I give
this land; and there he builded an altar unto the Lord,
who appeared unto him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver and in
gold; and Lot also, who went with Abraham, had
flocks and herds. And there was a strife between the
herdsmen of Abraham and the herdsmen of Lot about
the pastures. And Abraham said unto Lot: Let there
be no strife, I pray thee, between thee and me, and
between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are
brethren. Is not the land before thee? If thou wilt
take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>thou take the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Lot saw that the plain of Jordan was well watered,
that it was like the land of Egypt, even as the garden
of Jehovah. So Lot chose the plain for himself, and
pitched his tents toward Sodom. But the inhabitants
of Sodom were wicked, and sinners against the Lord
exceedingly. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 12-13.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT9' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>9. Abraham Delivers Lot</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Kings from the East came and made war against
the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, were victorious
over them, and carried off the people and their goods.
They also carried off Lot and all his goods. When
Abraham heard that his brother’s son was taken captive,
he led forth his trained men, to the number of
318, pursued the enemy and overtook them; and he
brought back all the goods, and set Lot and the people
free. When Abraham returned, Melchizedek, king of
Salem and priest of God Most High, went out to him
with bread and wine, and blessed him.&#8212;And the king
of Sodom came and said unto Abraham: Take the
goods to thyself and give me the people. But Abraham
answered: I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet,
lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abraham
rich. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 14.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT10' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>10. Abraham is Strong in Faith</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Lord appeared again unto Abraham and
promised him that his seed should become as numerous
as the stars of the heavens. Abraham was old,
and Sarah was old, and they had no children; but
Abraham believed the Lord’s promise, and He reckoned
it to him for righteousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abraham sat in the door of his tent in the heat of
the day. As he lifted up his eyes, lo, three men stood
over against him. Abraham ran to meet them, bowed
himself to the earth and said: My lord, pass not by
thy servant: let now a little water be fetched, and
wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and let me fetch a morsel of bread to strengthen you;
after that you shall pass on. And they said: So do,
as thou hast said. And Abraham ran unto the herd
and had a good calf dressed and prepared, and Sarah
took fine meal and baked cakes. And he took butter
and milk and set before the men, and he stood by
them under the tree, while they did eat. Then one
of them said: Where is Sarah your wife? Abraham
answered: She is in the tent. Then said he: In a
year I will return, and Sarah shall then have a
son. Sarah heard this in the tent and laughed; for
she thought she was too old to have children. But
the one who was the Lord said: Is anything too wonderful
for the Lord? <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 15:5, 6; 18:1-14.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT11' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>11. Abraham Prays for Sodom</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>And the men rose up, and Abraham followed them.
Then the Lord said: I will destroy Sodom; for its sins
are grievous. The two angels went toward Sodom,
and Abraham stood alone before the Lord and said:
Wilt Thou consume the righteous with the wicked?
Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city;
wilt Thou not spare it for the sake of these? The Lord
answered: If I find fifty righteous I will not consume
it. Abraham said: Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes;
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty, wilt
Thou destroy the whole city for lack of five? The
Lord answered: I will not destroy it if I find there
forty and five. And Abraham continued to pray, until
he came down to ten, and the Lord promised to spare
the city if He should find ten righteous in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the two angels came to Sodom and
went in to Lot. Then the men in the city surrounded
Lot’s house to seize the angels; but they smote them
with blindness, and brought Lot and his wife and his
two daughters out of the city. And one of the angels
said: Look not behind thee, neither stay in all the
plain; escape to the mountain. But Lot’s wife looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>back, and she became a pillar of salt. Then the Lord
rained fire from heaven, and the fertile plain where
Sodom and Gomorrah stood became the Dead Sea.&#8212;Thus
it appeared that there were not ten righteous
in Sodom. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 18:16-33; 19.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT12' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>12. God Proves Abraham</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>God visited Sarah at the time He had promised,
and she bare a son, who was called Isaac. Abraham
was then 100 years old, and Sarah was 90.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some years after this it came to pass that God
proved Abraham and said: Take now thy son, Isaac,
thine only son, whom thou lovest, and get thee into
the land of Moriah and offer him on one of the mountains
which I will tell thee of. Abraham rose early in
the morning, saddled his ass, took two of his young
men with him and Isaac his son; and he clave the
wood for the burnt offering, and went unto the place
of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham
lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. He
said then to his young men: Abide ye here, and I and
the lad will go yonder and worship. And he took the
wood for the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac, and
he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they
went both of them together. Then Isaac said: Father,
here is wood and fire; but where is the lamb for a
burnt offering? Abraham answered: God will provide
himself the lamb, my son. So they went both of them
together. When they came to the place, Abraham
built an altar, laid the wood in order, bound Isaac and
laid him upon the wood. And he stretched forth his
hand and took the knife to slay his son. Then the
Lord called unto him out of heaven and said: Abraham,
Abraham! Lay not thy hand upon the lad,
neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know
that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld
thy son, thine only son from me. Abraham lifted up
his eyes, and saw a ram behind him, caught in the
thicket by his horns. And he took the ram and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his
son.&#8212;God called the second time out of heaven and
said: Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son, from me, I will
exceedingly bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed
as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is
upon the sea shore; and in thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed. So Abraham returned
unto his young men and went with them to his home.
(Gen. 22:1-19.)</p>

<h3 id='OT13' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>13. Isaac</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When Sarah was dead, Abraham said to Eliezer,
who ruled his house: Promise me that thou wilt not
take one of the daughters of the Canaanites to be a
wife for my son; but thou shalt go unto my country
and to my kindred and take a wife for my son Isaac.
Eliezer then took ten of his master’s camels, having
all goodly things of his master’s in his hand, and he
went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. And he
made his camels kneel down without the city by the
well at the time of evening, the time that women go
out to draw water. And he said: Lord, God of Abraham,
show this day kindness unto my master. I
stand now by this well, and the daughters of the men
of the city come out to draw water. I will then say
to one of them: Let me drink of thy pitcher. If she
answer: Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also;
let the same be she that thou hast appointed as wife
for Thy servant Isaac. Before he yet had done speaking,
Rebekah came out, and she was very fair, and she
had her pitcher on her shoulder and went to the well
and filled her pitcher. And the servant went to her
and said: Give me to drink, I pray thee, of thy pitcher.
And she said: Drink, my lord, and I will give thy
camels drink also, and she drew water for all his
camels. And he wondered greatly while he looked on.
When all the camels had done drinking he gave her
a ring and two bracelets of gold and said: Whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>daughter are you? Is there room in your father’s
house for us to lodge in? She said: I am the daughter
of Bethuel, the son of Nahor. We have both straw
and provender enough, and room to lodge in. Then
the man bowed his head, worshipped the Lord and
said: Blessed be the Lord, who hath led me in the way
to the house of my master’s brother. And Rebekah
ran home and told all these words.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rebekah’s brother, Laban, ran out to the man,
brought him into the house, gave the camels straw
and provender, and set food before him to eat; but he
said: I will not eat until I have told mine errand.
When he had told all, Laban and Bethuel answered:
This comes from the Lord; take Rebekah and go,
and let her be thy master’s son’s wife. And they
called Rebekah, and said unto her: Wilt thou go with
this man? And she said: I will go. Then Eliezer
took her and went his way. And Isaac brought her
into Sarah’s tent, and she became his wife, and he
loved her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abraham lived happy in the faith in the Savior,
who was to come. He was 175 years old when he died
and was gathered to his people. Isaac became heir of
all that he had, and became a chief for his people, and
the Lord blessed him and said: Unto thee and thy seed
will I give the land of Canaan, and in thy seed shall
all the nations of the earth be blessed. (Gen. 24; 25:
1-11; 26:3, 4.)</p>

<h3 id='OT14' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>14. Esau and Jacob</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Twenty years had passed, and Rebekah had no
children. Then the Lord said to her: Thou shalt bear
two sons, and the elder shall serve the younger. When
her time came, she bore twins; the first-born was
hairy all over, and was called Esau, and the second
was called Jacob. And the boys grew, and Esau was
a skilful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a
quiet man dwelling in tents. And Isaac loved Esau,
but Rebekah loved Jacob. Once when Jacob had boiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>pottage and Esau came in from the field, feeling faint,
Esau said: Give me, I pray thee, the pottage. Jacob
answered: Sell me first thy birthright. And Esau said:
Behold, I am about to die; what profit shall the birthright
do to me? So he sold his birthright to Jacob
for that pottage of lentils, and he did eat and drink,
and rose up and went his way, and he despised his
birthright. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 25:23-34.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT15' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>15. Jacob Obtains the Blessing</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When Isaac was old and nearly blind, he said one
day to Esau: Take thy quiver and thy bow, go out to
the field, and take me venison, and make me savory
food, that I may eat thereof and bless thee before I
die. Rebekah, who heard this, told Jacob to go to the
father in Esau’s stead and obtain the blessing. Jacob
answered: My brother is a hairy man, and I am a
smooth man. My father may feel me, and I shall bring
a curse upon me, and not a blessing. But she persuaded
him, killed two kids of the goats and made
savory food, and she put the skins of the kids of
goats upon Jacob’s hands and neck, and he went to
his father and asked for the blessing. Isaac said:
How is it that thou found it so quickly, my son?
Jacob answered: The Lord thy God sent me good
speed. Isaac said: Come nearer, my son, that I may
feel thee. And he felt him and said: The voice is
Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
And he did eat of Jacob’s food, and blessed him and
set him as lord over his brother, as if he were the
first-born, and said: Cursed be every one that curseth
thee, and blessed be every one that blesseth thee.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacob was scarce gone out before Esau came in
from his hunting, made savory food, and brought it in
to his father and said: Let my father eat of his son’s
venison, that thy soul may bless me. Isaac said:
Who art thou? Esau answered: I am Esau, thy first-born
son. Then Isaac trembled exceedingly and said:
Who then is he that hath taken venison and brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>it to me, and I have eaten of it, and blessed him? and
he shall be blessed. Esau answered: Hast thou not
reserved a blessing for me? Bless even me also, O
my father! And he lifted up his voice and wept.
And Isaac said: By thy sword shalt thou live, and
thou shalt serve thy brother.&#8212;Esau hated Jacob because
of the blessing, and threatened to slay him when
his father died. Then said Rebekah unto Jacob: Flee
to my brother Laban, and tarry with him until thy
brother’s fury turn away. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 27.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT16' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>16. Jacob Goes to Laban</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Jacob went away from home, and when the sun
was set he lighted upon a certain place and tarried
there all night; and he took a stone, and put it under
his head and slept. And he dreamed that a ladder was
set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven,
and the angels of God were ascending and descending
on it. And the Lord stood above it and said: I am
the God of Abraham and of Isaac: the land whereon
thou liest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed; and
thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and in thy
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And
I will be with thee and bring thee again into this land.
When Jacob awoke he said: How dreadful is this
place! This is the house of God, this is the gate of
heaven!</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacob journeyed eastward and came to Laban, his
mother’s brother, and he abode with him the space of
a month. Then Laban said to him: What shall thy
wages be? And Laban had two daughters, Leah and
Rachel; and Rachel was beautiful. Therefore Jacob
said: I will serve thee seven years for Rachel. And
the seven years seemed unto him but a few days,
for he loved her. When the seven years were finished
Laban gave Leah to him: Jacob said: Did I not
serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast
thou beguiled me? Laban said: It is not customary
with us to give away the younger before the firstborn.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the
other also. Jacob did so, and then Laban gave him
Rachel to wife. Then Jacob had to serve seven other
years for Rachel. Afterward he served six years for
wages, and God blessed him, so he became very rich.
When he saw that Laban became envious of this he
went away with his wives and children and all that
he had. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 28-29.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT17' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>17. Jacob Meets Esau</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When Jacob drew near to Canaan, he sent messengers
to Esau to find favor in his sight. The messengers
returned and said: Thy brother is coming
to meet thee, and 400 men with him. Then Jacob was
greatly afraid, and he sent a present from his herds
and flocks to Esau, and prayed earnestly to the Lord.
And the Lord appeared unto him as a man that
wrestled with him. But Jacob held out manfully and
said: I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
God blessed him, and called him Israel, that is, one
who strives with God.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Jacob saw Esau he bowed himself to the
ground seven times; but Esau ran to meet him, and
embraced him and kissed him, and they both wept.&#8212;Isaac
died old (180 years) and full of days, and Esau
and Jacob buried him. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 32; 33; 35:28-29.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT18' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>18. Joseph Sold by His Brothers</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Jacob had 12 sons, of whom Reuben was the oldest;
Joseph and Benjamin, the sons of Rachel, were
the youngest. Joseph was feeding the flocks with his
brothers, and he brought evil report of them unto
their father. Now, Jacob loved him more than his
other sons, and he made him a long garment. The
brothers who saw this hated him, and could not
speak peaceably unto him. And Joseph dreamed a
dream, and he told it to his brothers: We were binding
sheaves in the field, and your sheaves bowed
down to my sheaf. And he dreamed another dream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and told it: The sun and the moon and eleven stars
bowed down to me. Then his brothers said to him:
Shalt thou indeed reign over us? And they hated him
yet more. And his father rebuked him and said:
What is this dream, thou hast dreamed? Shall I and
thy mother and thy brothers come to bow down ourselves
to thee? But his father kept the saying in his
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once, when the other sons were feeding the flocks
in Shechem, Jacob said to Joseph: Go now, see
whether it is well with thy brothers and the flock.
And Joseph went. When they saw him afar off, they
said: Behold, this dreamer cometh, let us slay him, and
we shall see what will become of his dreams. But
Reuben, who wished to deliver him, said: Shed no
blood, but cast him into this pit. And Joseph came
to his brothers, and they stripped him of his coat and
cast him into the pit, which was empty. And they
sat down to eat; and some merchants came with their
camels bearing spices and balsam to Egypt. Judah
said: Let us sell him to these merchants, and let not
our hand be upon him; for he is our brother. And
they sold him for 20 pieces of silver. Reuben had
meanwhile been away. When he returned to the pit,
and Joseph was not there, he went to his brothers and
said: The child is not there, and I, whither shall I go?
They then killed a he-goat and dipped the coat in the
blood, and sent it to their father and said: This have
we found; know now whether it is thy son’s coat?
And he knew it and said: It is my son’s coat; an evil
beast has devoured him. And he mourned for his son
many days, wept and would not be comforted. (Gen.
37.)</p>

<h3 id='OT19' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>19. Joseph is Thrown Into Prison</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The merchants brought Joseph to Egypt and sold
him to Potiphar, the captain of the life-guard of
Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. God was with Joseph
and made him to prosper, and Potiphar made him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>overseer over his house. Potiphar’s wife cast her
eyes upon Joseph to seduce him; but Joseph answered:
How can I do this great wickedness and sin
against God? She then accused him to her husband,
saying: This stranger tried to seduce me. Potiphar
believed his wife, and cast Joseph into prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>God was with Joseph and gave him favor with the
keeper of the prison, and he set him over the other
prisoners. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 39.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT20' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>20. Joseph Interprets Dreams</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Pharaoh became offended at his chief butler and
his chief baker, and cast them into the prison where
Joseph was. When Joseph came to them one morning,
he saw that they were sad. The butler said:
I dreamed that I saw a vine with three branches, and
on the branches were grapes. I took them and pressed
the juice into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into
Pharaoh’s hand. Joseph said: Within three days
Pharaoh will restore thee unto thine office; but have
me in remembrance who am innocent in this prison.&#8212;The
baker told his dream and said: I had three baskets
of white bread on my head, and in the uppermost
basket there was baked food for Pharaoh; and the
birds did eat it out of the basket. Joseph said: In
three days Pharaoh shall take thy head. And it came
to pass, as Joseph had interpreted; but the butler
forgot him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two years afterward Pharaoh dreamed that he
stood by the river Nile. Then there came up out of
the river seven fat cows and grazed on the bank.
After them came seven lean cows, and devoured the
former, but they were still lean. Afterwards he
dreamed that seven full and good ears of grain grew
on one stalk, and after them seven thin ears that
swallowed the former. None of the wise men of
Egypt could interpret the dream. Then the butler
remembered Joseph, and Pharaoh sent and called
Joseph out of the prison, and said: I have heard say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of thee that when thou hearest a dream thou canst
interpret it. Joseph answered: It is not in me; God
will give Pharaoh an answer of peace. When he had
heard the dreams, he interpreted them thus: There
shall come seven years of great plenty, and after them
seven years of famine that shall consume all that
remains from the seven years of plenty. When
Pharaoh heard the interpretation he set Joseph over
the whole land of Egypt, and Joseph went through
the land, and stored up grain during the seven years
of plenty. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 40, 41.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT21' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>21. The Brothers of Joseph Come to Egypt</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The famine was sore in all lands, but in Egypt
there was grain. And Jacob sent ten of his sons to
Egypt to buy grain; but he would not let Benjamin
go. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down
themselves to him. They knew not him, but he knew
them, and remembered his dreams. They said: We
are twelve brothers; the youngest is this day with our
father, and one is not. But Joseph said: Ye are spies.
And he kept them in prison for three days. On the
third day he said to them: One of you shall remain in
prison; but the others may go home with the grain,
and ye shall bring your youngest brother to me, that
I may see whether ye speak the truth. They said one
to another: We are verily guilty concerning our
brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul when
he besought us, and we would not hear him. And
they knew not that Joseph understood them; but he
turned himself about from them and wept. Simeon
was kept, and the others went home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jacob would not let Benjamin go with them, but
said: Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and
Benjamin ye will also take! But the famine was sore
in the land, so he must needs send Benjamin. The
brothers went to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
When he saw Benjamin he said: God be gracious to
thee, my son. And he went out and wept. And he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>washed his face, and he went in and refrained himself,
and said to his servants: Set on bread.&#8212;And he
commanded the steward of his house: Fill the men’s
sacks with grain and put my silver cup in Benjamin’s
sack. When they were not yet gone far off he sent
his steward after them, the sacks were searched, and
the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. Joseph would
retain Benjamin as his slave; but Judah stood forth
and said: Let me remain in his stead, for if we have
not him with us, we will bring our father’s gray hairs
with sorrow into the grave. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 42-44.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT22' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>22. Joseph Makes Himself Known</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Then Joseph could not refrain himself any longer,
but said: I am Joseph. Doth my father yet live? His
brothers could not answer him for fear; but Joseph
spoke kindly to them, kissed them all, and wept on
Benjamin’s neck. Afterwards he said: Make haste,
and go home and tell my father that I am lord of all
Egypt, and bring him hither. They went home and
told all this; but Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed
them not. But when he saw the wagons which
Joseph had sent, he said: It is enough; Joseph, my
son, is yet alive; I will go down and see him before
I die. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 45.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT23' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>23. Jacob Goes Down to Egypt</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Lord spoke to Jacob in a vision, saying: Fear
not to go down to Egypt, for I will be with thee and
bring thee up again, and Joseph shall close thine eyes.
So Jacob moved down to Egypt with his whole family,
70 souls, and all that he had. When Joseph heard of
his coming he made ready his chariot, and went up to
meet him in Goshen. And he fell on his father’s neck
and wept a good while. Jacob said: Now let me die,
since I have seen that thou art yet alive.&#8212;On Pharaoh’s
command Joseph gave unto his father Goshen
to dwell in, for in Goshen were good pastures, and
Jacob and his sons were shepherds.&#8212;Jacob lived in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Egypt 17 years, and became 147 years old. A short
time before his death he blessed Joseph’s two sons,
Manasseh and Ephraim, and added: They shall be my
sons, even as Reuben and Simeon. After that he
gathered all his sons about him, blessed them and told
them what should befall them in the latter days, and
foretold of the Savior, whom he called the Prince of
Peace.&#8212;Joseph brought his body up to Canaan and
buried it in the sepulchre of Abraham and Isaac.</p>

<p class='c009'>Joseph’s brothers feared that he would now revenge
himself on them. When he heard this, Joseph
wept and said: Am I in the place of God? Ye meant
evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save
much people alive.&#8212;Joseph died, being 110 years old,
and they embalmed his body and put it in a coffin in
Egypt to take it with them up to Canaan, when God
should visit them. <span class="nowrap">(Gen. 46-50.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT24' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>24. Moses Born and Hidden</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The children of Israel dwelt in Goshen for 430
years and became a numerous people. There arose a
new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph, and he
said: The Israelites are more and mightier than we,
and have become a menace to us. Therefore he afflicted
them with hard labor; but the more he afflicted them,
the more they multiplied, and the more they spread
abroad. Then he charged his people, saying: Every
son that is born to the Israelites ye shall cast into the
Nile, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this time a woman of the tribe of Levi bore a
son, and when she saw he was a goodly child, she hid
him three months. And when she could no longer
hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and
she put the child in it, and laid it in the flags by the
river’s bank. And his sister stood afar off, to know
what would be done to him. And the daughter of
Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and she
had the ark fetched, and opened it, and saw the child,
and behold, the babe wept; and she had compassion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>on him. Then his sister came and asked: Shall I go
and call a nurse? Pharaoh’s daughter said to her:
Go. And the maiden went and called the child’s
mother. And he grew, and the mother brought him
to Pharaoh’s daughter, and she called him Moses, that
is, one that is drawn out of the water. (Exodus 1; 2:
1-10.)</p>

<h3 id='OT25' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>25. Moses in Midian</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When Moses was forty years old he went out to
look on the burdens of his brethren, and he saw an
Egyptian smiting an Israelite. Moses looked this
way and that way, and when he saw that there was
no man, he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the
sand. When Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to
slay Moses, but he fled to Midian, and came to a
priest by the name of Jethro, who had seven daughters,
of whom he gave Moses one, Zipporah, for wife.
And Moses dwelt in Midian forty years.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once, when he kept Jethro’s flocks at Mount
Horeb, he saw a bush which burned and was not consumed.
When he drew near to see, the Lord spoke
to him from the bush: I am the God of Abraham and
of Isaac and of Jacob; I have seen the affliction of my
people and have heard their cry; now I will send thee
to Pharaoh, and thou shalt bring my people out of
Egypt. Moses answered: My brethren will not believe
that Thou hast sent me. The Lord said: Cast
thy rod on the ground. Moses did so, and it became a
serpent, and Moses fled from it. At the Lord’s command
Moses took it by the tail, and it became a rod
again. The Lord gave him power to work other wonders;
but Moses continued to excuse himself and said:
I am slow of speech. The Lord answered: I will send
thy brother Aaron to thee, and thou shalt put the
words in his mouth, and he shall speak for thee.
Then Moses returned to Egypt. He met Aaron on the
road, and he went with him to the Israelites and told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>them the words of the Lord, and they rejoiced and
bowed their heads and worshipped the Lord. (Ex.
2:15-4:31.)</p>

<h3 id='OT26' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>26. Israel Departs from Egypt</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh: Thus
saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Let my people go.
Pharaoh answered: Who is Jehovah, that I should
hearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know Him
not, and moreover I will not let Israel go.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moses now performed the wonders that God had
given him, but Pharaoh hardened his heart and would
not let the people go. Then God said unto Moses:
Take thy rod and smite the waters in the Nile. Moses
did so, and the waters became blood. When this did
not help, God sent nine other plagues upon Egypt.
The eighth plague was numberless locusts that covered
all the land, and ate every green thing, and the ninth
was a thick darkness that lasted for three days; but in
Goshen there were no locusts, and there it was light.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lord now bade Moses speak to the children
of Israel and say: Tonight ye shall kill a lamb in
every house, and ye shall take the blood and put it on
the two door posts; ye shall roast the lamb and eat it
with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; and ye shall
stand with your staff in hand, ready to go out.&#8212;Thus
the Lord instituted the Passover.</p>

<p class='c009'>At midnight the Lord passed through Egypt and
slew all the first-born, from the first-born of Pharaoh
to the first-born of the slave. But He saw the blood
on the dwellings of Israel and passed over. And
there was a great cry in Egypt, and Pharaoh urged
Israel to go. So the Israelites went out of Egypt,
600,000 men who could go out to battle, and Moses
took the bones of Joseph with him. And the Lord
went before them in a pillar of fire by night and in a
pillar of cloud by day, and he led them toward the
Red Sea. But Pharaoh regretted that he had let Israel
depart, and he pursued them with all his chariots and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>overtook them at the Red Sea. Then the Israelites
murmured against Moses and said: Were there not
graves enough in Egypt, that thou must take us out
in the wilderness to die? Moses answered: Today
you shall see the salvation of the Lord. And he
stretched forth his hand, and the waters were divided,
and the children of Israel walked over on dry ground,
while the water stood as a wall on the right hand
and on the left. The Egyptians pursued them, but
when they were in the midst of the Red Sea, and the
Israelites had passed over, Moses again stretched out
his hand, and the waters returned and buried all the
host of Pharaoh. <span class="nowrap">(Ex. 5-14.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT27' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>27. Wandering in the Wilderness</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The children of Israel were now come into the
wilderness of Arabia. Here they lacked both water
and food, murmured against Moses, and wished they
were back to the flesh-pots in Egypt. Moses smote
the rock with his rod, and there flowed water; and
the Lord sent them manna for food. This lay every
morning like hoar-frost on the ground, and melted
when the sun rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the third month after they had gone out of
Egypt, the Israelites encamped at Mount Sinai. On
the third day a thick cloud covered the mountain, and
there was heard a sound as of a loud trumpet. The
mountain shook and smoked as a furnace, for the Lord
descended in fire on the mountain. The Lord then
spoke thus to the people:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless
that taketh His name in vain.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days
may be long in the land which the Lord thy God
giveth thee.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Thou shalt not kill.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>6. Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Thou shalt not steal.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor
his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor
his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s. (Ex.
16-20.)</p>

<p class='c012'>At the command of the Lord, Moses afterwards
gave laws concerning worship. He made Aaron high
priest, and after him his oldest son, and thus successively
from son to son. The other sons of Aaron became
priests, and the other descendants of Levi, or
the Levites, became their assistants.&#8212;A Tabernacle,
or large tent, was raised and divided into two parts:
The Holy of Holies and the Holy Place. In the Holy
of Holies was a chest, called the Ark of the Covenant,
and a pot filled with manna. The ark was overlaid
with gold, the cover was of pure gold, and was called
the Mercy Seat. Only the high priest might enter the
Holy of Holies, and even he only once a year. The
Holy Place was for the priests. Round about the
Tabernacle was the Court, which was without a roof,
here the people should assemble.&#8212;The seventh day
of the week was the day of rest, or the Sabbath.&#8212;There
were three great feasts: The Passover, in memory
of the passing out of Egypt; The Feast of Weeks,
or Pentecost; and The Feast of Tabernacles, in memory
of Israel’s living in tents.&#8212;There were many kinds
of sacrifices. The most important sacrifice was
brought on the great Feast of Atonement, when the
high priest went into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled
the blood of an ox and of a he-goat on the Mercy Seat
for the sins of himself and of the people. (Ex. 23-29;
Lev. 16.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lord said to Moses: Come up to me on the
mountain, and I will give thee the Tables of the Law.
Moses was with the Lord for 40 days and 40 nights.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>And the Lord gave him the two Tables of the Law.
They were written on both sides; the writing was the
writing of God; it was written by God’s own finger.&#8212;While
Moses was on the mountain the people said to
Aaron: Make us a god which shall go before us; for
Moses does not return. Aaron made a golden calf,
and the people danced around it. When Moses came
down from the mountain and saw the calf and the
dancing, his anger was kindled, and he cast the tables
against the mountain so they broke; and he took the
golden calf and ground it to powder and strewed it
on the brook that runs down the mountain. Then he
bade the Levites go with drawn swords through the
camp, and 3,000 were killed on the same day.&#8212;Moses
went again on the mountain, and was there for 40
days and 40 nights, and he ate no bread and drank no
water, and the Lord wrote the ten commandments on
two new tables of stone. These were afterward kept
in the Ark of the Covenant. <span class="nowrap">(Ex. 24, 32, 34.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>The Israelites went from Sinai toward Canaan, and
Moses sent twelve spies into the country. These
returned, saying: The land is very good; but we are as
grasshoppers compared to the inhabitants, of such
stature are they. But Joshua and Caleb, two of the
spies, replied: We can subdue the land, for the Lord is
with us. But it availed not. The people would not go
against the Canaanites, but wished to choose a new
leader and return to Egypt. Then the glory of the
Lord appeared in the Tabernacle, and the Lord spoke
thus by Moses: For forty years shall ye wander about
in this wilderness, until all those are dead who were
20 years old or over when ye went out of Egypt; none
who hath seen my wonders in Egypt shall come into
Canaan, except Joshua and Caleb. <span class="nowrap">(Num. 13-14.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Thus they must for 40 years wander about in the
terrible wilderness among serpents and in dry places.
But the Lord sustained them, so their clothes were not
worn out, and their feet swelled not. Nevertheless
they murmured against the Lord and many times tried
His patience. Thus they once complained that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>had neither food nor drink. The Lord then sent fiery
serpents among them, and many died from their sting.
The people humbled themselves, and Moses interceded
for them. The Lord said: Make a serpent of brass and
set it upon a standard. When any one had been bitten
by a serpent, and he looked up to the serpent of brass,
he lived. <span class="nowrap">(Num. 21.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>When the 40 years were ended, the Israelites had
come so near to Canaan that only the river Jordan lay
between. Moses now went up into Mount Nebo, and
the Lord showed him all the land and said: This is
the land which I have promised to Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob; but thou shalt not enter it. There Moses,
the servant of the Lord, died, 120 years old, and the
Lord buried him. There never arose a prophet in
Israel with whom the Lord spoke thus face to face.

<p class='c008'>The Lord chose Joshua for leader in the place of
Moses, and said to him: As I was with Moses, so will
I be with thee. When the Israelites had mourned for
Moses 30 days, they made themselves ready to go over
Jordan. The priests went before with the Ark of the
Covenant, and when their feet touched the waters of
Jordan, the water flowed away below and stood still
above, and the Israelites went over on dry ground.
The manna now ceased, and they ate of the fruit of
the land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jericho was a city surrounded with strong walls;
but the Israelites took it without sword and bow. For
six days the priests with the ark and all the armed
men walked around the city, once every day; but on
the seventh day they went around it seven times, and
the seventh time the priests blew the trumpets and the
people shouted, and the walls fell, and the town was
taken.&#8212;After seven years Joshua had subdued 31
kings, and divided the land among the twelve tribes of
Israel. The tribe of Levi received no separate portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of land, but 48 cities were given them among the other
tribes.</p>

<p class='c009'>After many years Joshua gathered the tribes of
Israel together and said to them: Choose ye this day
whom ye will serve, the Lord or the gods of the
heathens; but as for me and my house, we will serve
the Lord. The people said: We will serve the Lord
and hearken to His voice.&#8212;Joshua died 110 years old.
(Book of Joshua.)</p>

<h3 id='OT29' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>29. Gideon, Jephthah, Samson</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Israelites served the Lord while Joshua lived;
but when he was dead they forgot the Lord, married
the daughters of the Canaanites and served strange
gods. Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against
them, and He gave them into the hands of the heathens.
They then cried unto the Lord, and he raised up
men to save them. Such men were called Judges.
(Judges 2.)</p>

<p class='c009'>One of these judges was Gideon. The hand of the
Midianites rested heavily on Israel. Then the angel
of the Lord came to Gideon, as he was threshing
wheat, and bade him deliver Israel. Gideon sent
messengers to the tribes, and 32,000 men responded.
But the Lord said: There are too many people. Israel
might boast and say: My own hand hath saved me.
Proclaim therefore that whoever is afraid may go
home. Then 22,000 went home, and 10,000 remained.
The Lord said: The people are yet too many. Choose
thee 300 men. Gideon chose 300 men and divided them
into three companies, and gave each man a trumpet
and an empty pitcher with a torch in it. At midnight
he went with them to the camp of the Midianites;
they blew the trumpets, broke the pitchers and held
up their torches. The Midianites cried and fled, and
the Lord turned every man’s sword against his neighbor,
and Gideon pursued them. <span class="nowrap">(Judges 6-9.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Another judge was Jephthah. When he went out
against the enemy he made a vow to sacrifice to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Lord whatever first came to meet him from his house,
when he returned with victory. He came home victorious,
and his daughter, his only child, came out to
meet him with timbrels and with dances. Jephthah
rent his garments, but did with her according to his
vow. And the maidens of Israel lamented Jephthah’s
daughter for four days every year. <span class="nowrap">(Judges 11.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>When the Philistines oppressed the children of
Israel, the Lord sent them a deliverer in Samson. He
smote the Philistines again and again, for the Lord
had given him such strength that he with his hands
tore asunder a young lion which came roaring against
him. But he was deluded by a woman called Delilah.
She succeeded in coaxing out of him the secret that
his strength was in his seven locks of hair. These she
shaved off and delivered him to the lords of the Philistines,
who put out his eyes and set him to grinding
corn. Once when they were assembled for a great
feast in the temple of Dagon, their god, they brought
out Samson to make sport for them. His hair had now
grown, and his strength had returned. The temple
rested on pillars. Samson prayed to the Lord, laid
hold on the two middle pillars, and bowed himself
with might. The temple fell and buried both Samson
and his enemies. <span class="nowrap">(Judges 13-16.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT30' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>30. Ruth</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>At the time the judges ruled in Israel there was a
famine in the land, and a man went from Bethlehem
to the land of the Moabites with his wife Naomi and
his two sons. The man died, and the sons married
women of Moab, Orpah and Ruth. After ten years
both the sons were dead, and Naomi made ready to
return to the land of her fathers. Orpah and Ruth
went with her. On the way Naomi said: Go back,
my daughters! The Lord deal kindly with you, as ye
have dealt with the dead and with me. Orpah went
back; but Ruth said: Thy people shall be my people,
and thy God shall be my God; only death shall part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>us. So they went together and came to Bethlehem.
It was at the time of the barley harvest, and Ruth went
out to glean heads of grain and came on a field of a
rich man by the name of Boaz. When Boaz learned
that it was Ruth, who had come with Naomi, he said
to the reapers: Let grain fall on the ground that she
may glean so much more. And to Ruth he said: If
thou thirst come hither and drink, and if thou hunger
come hither and eat of my bread. Ruth said: How
have I, a stranger, found favor in thine eyes? Boaz
answered: I have heard what thou hast done for thy
mother-in-law: Thou hast left father and mother and
art come to a people thou didst not know. A full
reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel,
under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.
When the harvest was over Boaz took Ruth to wife,
and she bore a son who was called Obed. He was the
father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David the
king. (Book of Ruth.)</p>

<h3 id='OT31' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>31. Eli and Samuel</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Eli was high priest and judge. He had two sons
who were exceedingly wicked; but he did not restrain
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy Samuel, a son of Elkanah and Hannah, was
brought up by Eli and slept in the Tabernacle of the
Lord. One night the Lord called Samuel, and Samuel,
who did not yet know the Lord, ran to Eli; but Eli
answered: I did not call thee, lie down again. The
Lord called yet two times to Samuel, and he ran each
time to Eli. The high priest now perceived that it
was the Lord who called Samuel, and said to him:
If he call thee again, answer: Speak, Lord, for Thy
servant heareth. Samuel lay down again, and the
Lord called the fourth time to Samuel, and he answered
according to Eli’s words. And the voice of
the Lord said: Because Eli saw that his sons were
wicked, and yet he did not restrain them, therefore I
will send destruction upon him and upon his house.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>In the morning when Eli learned what the Lord had
said, he replied: It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth
him good.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was war with the Philistines, and the Israelites
were defeated. So they brought the Ark of the
Covenant to the camp; but they were again routed,
and the Ark was captured by the Philistines. Eli
was at that time 98 years old. He was seated in a
chair by the wayside watching; for he was anxious
for the Ark of God. One who had fled from the battle
came and said: Israel is defeated, thy sons are fallen,
and God’s Ark is taken. When he heard about the
Ark of God, he fell backwards, and his neck was
broken, and he died.&#8212;The Philistines took the Ark
and put it in the temple of the idol Dagon. But as a
disease broke out in the land, they brought the Ark
back and sent presents with it. <span class="nowrap">(1 Sam. 1-6.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Samuel was the last of the judges. He journeyed
through the land and judged, and he was honored by
the people. When he was old he made his two sons
judges; but they walked not in the way of their
father, but sold judgment for money. Then the elders
of the people came to Samuel and said: Now make us
a king to judge us and go before us in our wars. This
thing displeased Samuel, but the Lord said to him:
Hearken unto the voice of the people, for they have
not rejected thee, but me have they rejected, that I
should no longer be king over them. And the Lord
spoke again to Samuel and said: Tomorrow I will
send thee a man from the tribe of Benjamin; him
shalt thou anoint to be king over my people. On the
morrow Samuel saw a man of the tribe of Benjamin;
his name was Saul, the son of Kish. There was not
among the children of Israel a goodlier person than
he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher
than any of the people. The Lord said to Samuel:
Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee! And Samuel
brought him into his house, took a vial of oil, and
poured it upon his head and said: Now has the Lord
anointed thee to be king over His people. On that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>day the spirit of God came upon Saul, and the Lord
gave him another heart. Then Samuel ceased to be
judge. <span class="nowrap">(1 Sam. 7-10.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT32' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>32. Saul</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Saul was brave and overcame the enemy; but he
would also follow his own will and proved disobedient
to the law of the Lord. Samuel therefore said to him:
Thy kingdom shall not continue, for the Lord has
chosen a man after his own heart to be ruler over his
people. And the Lord said to Samuel: Fill thy horn
with oil and go to Bethlehem, and anoint David, the
youngest son of Jesse, to be king after Saul. And
Samuel went and anointed David, and the spirit of the
Lord came upon him from that day. But the spirit
of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from
the Lord troubled him. His servants brought David,
because he was skilful in playing the harp. When
the evil spirit came upon Saul, David played the harp
before him, and it went well with Saul, and the evil
spirit departed from him. <span class="nowrap">(1 Sam. 11-16.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT33' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>33. David and Goliath</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>There was again war with the Philistines. Among
them was a mighty champion by name Goliath, who
for 40 days came before the camp and mocked the
Israelites, because no one dared to meet him in combat.
The king promised to give his daughter to him
who could slay the champion. When David came to
the camp and learned this, he offered to go against
him. But Saul objected: Thou art young, and he is
a warrior from his youth. David answered: Once
while I kept my father’s sheep there came a lion and
a bear and took a lamb; but I went against them,
killed them and saved the lamb. The Lord who delivered
me from the lion and the bear will also deliver
me from this Philistine. Then Saul said: Go, and the
Lord be with thee. David took his staff and his sling
and five smooth stones from the brook, and went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>against Goliath. When the champion saw him he
cried: Am I a dog that thou comest against me with
staves? David answered: Thou comest against me
with sword and with spear; but I come against thee
in the name of the Lord, the God of hosts. Then he
put a stone in his sling and threw it, and struck the
champion in the forehead, so he fell to the earth.
David ran and drew the Philistine’s sword out of the
sheath, and cut off his head. David was placed over
the army, and later he got Saul’s daughter to wife.
And Jonathan, the son of Saul, loved David as his own
soul. <span class="nowrap">(1 Sam. 17.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT34' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>34. Saul Pursues David, Saul Dies</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When David returned after his victory over Goliath,
the women sang: Saul slew a thousand, but David
slew ten thousand. For this, Saul became suspicious
of David and was his enemy all his life. Twice
he threw his javelin at David to spear him to the wall,
while he stood playing before him. David was compelled
to flee, and wandered about from place to place,
for Saul was after him. When David once had hidden
in a cave, Saul came into the same cave. David would
not put forth his hand against the Lord’s anointed,
but went and cut off a piece of his garment. When
Saul had left the cave, David went out also and showed
him the piece. Saul wept and said: Thou art more
righteous than I, for thou hast rewarded evil with
good. And Saul went to his house.&#8212;Nevertheless he
again went in pursuit of David. While he and his
people slept, David came to his bed and took away
his spear and his cruse of water. When Saul saw
that David again had spared his life, he cried: Return,
my son David, for I will no more do thee harm! But
David went and dwelt in the land of the Philistines
until Saul’s death.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a great battle with the Philistines. Saul
was wounded, and Jonathan had fallen. Saul then
said to his armor-bearer: Thrust thy sword through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>me. But when he dared not lay his hand on the
Lord’s anointed, he placed the sword against his own
breast and fell upon it and died. David lamented in
a beautiful song the death of Saul and Jonathan.

<p class='c009'>After Saul was dead, David was made king, and
he reigned for 40 years. He captured Jerusalem and
made this city the capital, and then he and the whole
house of Israel brought the Ark of the Covenant
thither with shouts of joy and sound of trumpets. He
executed judgment and justice to the whole people,
and he remembered Jonathan and said to his son: I
restore to thee all the lands of Saul, and thou shalt
eat at my table. He was the light and the sweetest
singer of Israel, and composed many beautiful psalms,
which are found in the Book of Psalms in the Bible,
and speaks in many of these of the Messiah, or the
Savior who was to come. He subdued the nations
round about and was very powerful.</p>

<p class='c009'>David intended to build a house for the Lord. But
the Lord spoke to him through Nathan the prophet
and said: When thy days be fulfilled, I will set up thy
seed after thee. He shall build a house for my name,
and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure
for ever before thee, thy throne shall be established
for ever. <span class="nowrap">(2 Sam. 2-10.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT36' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>36. David’s Fall</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>While Joab was warring against the Ammonites,
David one evening saw from the roof of his house
a woman bathing. She was Bathsheba, the wife of
Uriah. He sent for her and committed adultery with
her, and sent a letter to Joab that he should set Uriah
where the battle was fiercest, that he might fall by
the hand of the Ammonites. Joab obeyed his lord, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Uriah was killed. When David got Joab’s message
about this he said: The sword devoureth one as well
as another. When the time of mourning had passed
for Bathsheba, he took her to wife. But the deed that
David had done was evil in the eyes of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lord sent the prophet Nathan unto David, and
he said: There were two men in one city, the one rich
and the other poor. The rich man had exceeding
many flocks and herds, but the poor man had nothing
save one little lamb, which did eat of his morsel and
drink of his cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto
him as a daughter. And there came a traveler unto
the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock
and of his own herd, but took the poor man’s only
lamb, and dressed it for the wayfaring man. And
David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man
and he said: The man that did this is a son of death,
and he shall restore the lamb fourfold. Nathan answered:
Thou art the man! Uriah hast thou smitten
with the sword of the Ammonites, and his wife hast
thou taken to be thy wife. David humbled himself
before the Lord and said: O God, create in me a clean
heart, and renew a right spirit within me. Thou delightest
not in sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou hast
no pleasure in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God
are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart, O
God, Thou wilt not despise. And the Lord forgave
him. But the son that Bathsheba bore him soon
died; and much sorrow came upon David in his old
age. <span class="nowrap">(2 Sam. 11-12.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT37' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>37. The Revolt of Absalom</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Absalom, a son of David, was the comeliest man in
Israel. There was no blemish on him from the sole
of his foot to the crown of his head. Although his
father loved him greatly, he conspired to be king in
his father’s stead. He would stand beside the road,
and when any one came and would bow down before
him, he embraced him and kissed him, and thus stole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the hearts of the men of Israel from his father. He
conspired with Ahithophel, David’s counsellor, and
came with an army against Jerusalem, and David was
forced to flee from his son. Ahithophel’s counsel was
to pursue David immediately; but Hushai, David’s
friend, advised Absalom to wait until he could raise
a larger army. The Lord, wishing to bring destruction
upon Absalom, caused Ahithophel’s good advice
to be rejected, and Ahithophel went and hanged himself.
David thus gained time to raise an army. He
set Joab over it, and commanded him saying: Deal
gently with the young man! There was a great battle
in a forest. Absalom was compelled to flee, and riding
under an oak, his head was caught in its boughs. The
mule on which he rode ran away, and he was left
hanging between heaven and earth. Joab ran and
thrust three javelins through his heart. When David
heard of this he wept and lamented: O Absalom, my
son, would I had died for thee! O Absalom, my son,
my son!&#8212;Some years later David died and Solomon,
the son of Bathsheba, became king. (2 Sam. 15-18;
1 Kings 1-2.)</p>

<h3 id='OT38' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>38. Solomon</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>God appeared unto Solomon in a dream and said:
Ask what I shall give thee. Solomon asked for wisdom.
Shortly after two women came to him. They
dwelt together, and each had given birth to a child.
As one of them had in the night overlaid her child
so that it died, she arose and took the child of the
other, and laid her own in its place. Both now asserted:
I am mother of the living child. Solomon
said: Fetch me a sword! When the sword was
brought, he said: Divide the child in two, and give
half to one and half to the other. Then the one cried:
Give her the child, and do not divide it. The other
said: Divide it, so it shall be neither mine nor thine.
Then Solomon said: Give the child to her who wills
that it shall live, for she is the mother. All Israel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>heard the judgment and feared the king, for they saw
that the wisdom of God was in him.&#8212;Solomon was
wiser than all other men, and the fame of his wisdom
spread abroad, and the queen of Sheba came to hear
him. He spoke 3000 proverbs, and his songs were
1005; he wrote of trees, from the cedar that grows on
Lebanon to the hyssop that springs out of the wall;
he wrote of beasts of the field, of birds, of creeping
things and of fishes. He had peace round about and
all Israel dwelt safely, each man under his vine and
fig tree. He traded with distant lands and gathered
gold and silver and precious stones in great abundance.
On Mount Moriah in Jerusalem he built a
magnificent temple instead of the Tabernacle, and put
the Ark in the Holy of Holies. When the temple was
finished, Solomon knelt down and prayed: O Lord,
the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain
Thee; how much less this house that I have builded!
Yet hear Thou in heaven, Thy dwelling place, every
humble prayer that shall be sent up to Thee from this
house! And when a stranger that is not of Israel
shall come and pray towards this house, then hear
Thou his prayers also!</p>

<p class='c009'>Solomon did not continue faithful to the end. He
had taken many heathen women to be his wives, and
when he was old they turned his heart, so that he
built altars to the abominable idols of the heathens.
And the people murmured because of heavy taxes and
burdens. <span class="nowrap">(1 Kings 3-11.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>When Solomon was dead, all Israel came together
and said to his son Rehoboam: Thy father made our
yoke heavy, make thou it lighter, and we will make
thee king. Rehoboam first took counsel from the old
men, who had been the counsellors of his father. They
said: If thou wilt hearken to the people this day they
will serve thee all thy days. Then he consulted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>young men who had grown up with him, and he answered
according to their counsel: My father’s yoke
was heavy, mine shall be heavier still; my father chastised
you with whips, I will chastise you with scorpions.
At this answer the people were provoked, and
ten tribes chose Jeroboam for king, and only Judah
and Benjamin clung to Rehoboam for David’s sake.&#8212;Samaria
became the capital of the ten tribes, or the
kingdom of Israel, and Jerusalem the capital for the
two tribes, or the kingdom of Judah. (1 Kings 12:
1-24.)</p>

<h3 id='OT40' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>40. The Kingdom of Israel, Jeroboam</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Jeroboam thought thus: If the people go up to
Jerusalem to worship the Lord, their hearts will again
turn to the house of David. He therefore set up two
golden calves, and the people went and sacrificed to
them. The Lord warned him, saying: Thou hast made
thyself strange gods, therefore I will cut off thy house.
His son became king, but was killed, and the whole
family destroyed. There came kings of other families;
but all were wicked and worshiped strange gods.
(1 Kings 12:25-15:30.)</p>

<h3 id='OT41' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>41. Ahab and Elijah</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The worst of all kings in Israel was Ahab. He
married the wicked Jezebel, daughter of the king of
Sidon, and built a temple for the idol Baal. The
prophet Elijah foretold as a punishment a drought
which lasted for three years, and the land thirsted for
rain. Meanwhile Elijah dwelt with a poor widow in
the city of Zarephath, and the meal in her jar was not
consumed, and the cruse of oil failed not, and when
her son died, Elijah prayed to the Lord, and the soul
of the child came into him again.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the three years were ended, Elijah went at
the Lord’s command unto Ahab and bade him call the
priests of Baal together on Mount Carmel. Then
said Elijah unto the people: I, even I only, am left a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>prophet of Jehovah; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred
and fifty men. Let them therefore give us two
bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves,
and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and
put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock,
and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under. And
call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the
name of Jehovah; and the God that answereth by
fire, let him be God. And all the people answered
and said: It is well spoken. The priests of Baal sacrificed
an ox and called upon their god the whole day;
but he answered not. Elijah said: Cry a little louder!
Your god may be musing, or perhaps he sleeps! At
evening Elijah sacrificed an ox and prayed: O Lord,
let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel,
and that I am Thy servant! Then there came fire
from heaven and consumed his sacrifice. The people
took the priests of Baal and slew them, and the heavens
grew black, and there was a great rain. Jezebel
sought the life of Elijah, but he fled to the wilderness
and wished that he might die, because Israel had
broken their covenant with the Lord. But the Lord
said: Return, there are yet left 7000 who have not
bowed the knee unto Baal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Naboth had a vineyard that Ahab wished to buy,
because it lay close up to his palace. When Naboth
would not sell his inheritance, because that was
against the law of Moses, Ahab was sad, went to bed
and would not eat. Jezebel said: Arise, eat and be
merry! I will give thee the vineyard. She bade the
judges procure witnesses to testify that Naboth had
blasphemed God and the king. Naboth was stoned,
and Ahab went to take possession of the vineyard.
The Lord sent Elijah to him in the vineyard to say:
Where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall
they also lick thy blood, and dogs shall eat Jezebel.
Ahab fell in battle, and his blood flowed into the war-chariot,
and when it was washed in Samaria, dogs
came and licked the blood. Jezebel was thrown out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>from a window, and her body was eaten by dogs.
(1 Kings 16-22; 2 Kings 9:30-37.)</p>

in a chariot of fire with horses of fire, and

<p class='c009'>The kings and the people of Israel continued to
worship strange gods, and would not listen to the
prophets of the Lord. So the punishment must come.
The king of Assyria, the powerful Shalmaneser, put
Hoshea, the last king, in chains, and his successor took
Samaria and carried the people to Assyria. One of
the later kings sent heathens from his countries to
dwell in the land. These were called Samaritans, and
learned more and more to know Jehovah; but the inhabitants
of Judah and Benjamin would not acknowledge
them as right brethren, and there was bitter
enmity between the Samaritans and the Jews. (2
Kings 17.)</p>

<h3 id='OT43' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>43. The Kingdom of Judah, Hezekiah and Isaiah</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>In Judah kings of the house of David always
reigned; many of them were wicked and served
strange gods; but a few were pious and served the
Lord, and thus idolatry did not come to such power as
in the kingdom of Israel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most pious of the kings was Hezekiah. Sennacherib,
the king of Assyria, came against Jerusalem
and used great words, saying: Believe not that your
God can deliver you, for the gods of the heathens were
not able to deliver their countries from the king of
Assyria. Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord
and prayed for deliverance. The prophet Isaiah sent
this message to him: The Lord has heard your prayer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The angel of the Lord passed through the camp of the
Assyrians and smote in one night 185,000, and Sennacherib
was compelled to return home in disgrace.&#8212;Shortly
after this Hezekiah became sick. Isaiah promised
to prolong his life fifteen years. The king of
Babylon sent messengers with gifts and greetings to
Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick.
Hezekiah was glad, and showed the messengers all
his treasures. Then Isaiah came and said: These
treasures shall all be carried away to Babylon, and
thy sons shall be servants in the palace of the king of
Babylon. <span class="nowrap">(2 Kings 10-20.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Isaiah has written many prophecies. Of our
Savior Jesus Christ he wrote: Surely He hath borne
our griefs and carried our sorrows; He was wounded
for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities;
the chastisement of our peace was upon Him,
and with His stripes we are healed. He was oppressed,
yet when He was afflicted He opened not His mouth,
as a lamb that is led to the slaughter. <span class="nowrap">(Isaiah 53.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>The people fell off from the Lord, and King Manasseh
sacrificed his own children to the idols, and the
punishment had to come upon the kingdom of Judah
also. The king of Babylon, the mighty Nebuchadnezzar,
took Jerusalem, burned the temple and the city
and tore down the walls. Zedekiah, the last king, was
forced to look upon the slaying of his own children;
then his eyes were put out, and he was placed in
chains and together with the people brought to Babylon
in captivity 588 years before the birth of Christ.
(2 Kings 21-25.)</p>

<h3 id='OT45' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>45. The Babylonian Captivity</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The sins of the Jews were great, and their punishment
was heavy. Now, when they were compelled to
live among the heathens, they longed for the Holy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>City and the worship in the temple of the Lord. Yet
the Lord left them not without consolation. From
the prophecies of the prophet Jeremiah they knew that
when 70 years were passed the Lord would have compassion
on them and bring them back to the land of
their fathers. And the Lord sent two great prophets
to them to console and strengthen them. These were
Ezekiel and Daniel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nebuchadnezzar had a dream which he could not
remember. Daniel prayed to the Lord, and both the
dream and the explanation of it were shown him in a
vision in the night. The king had seen a great image.
The head was of gold, the breast and arms of silver,
the belly and thighs of brass, and the legs of iron and
of clay. A stone which was not thrown by the hands
of man struck the image and broke it to pieces; but
the stone became a great mountain which filled the
whole earth. Daniel interpreted the dream thus:
There shall arise four great kingdoms after each other;
afterward God will establish a kingdom that shall
overthrow all these, but shall itself remain forever.&#8212;The
king said: Thy God is a God above all gods, since
he can reveal secret things. Daniel was now made
ruler of the wise men of the country and remained in
great respect and honor even after the death of Nebuchadnezzar.
But he had enemies, and these caused one
of the following kings to throw him into a den of
lions; but the Lord sent him His angel who shut the
mouths of the lions. The next day Daniel was pulled
up from the den unhurt, and the men that had accused
him were cast into it; but they had not even reached
the bottom of the den before the lions seized them and
broke their bones. <span class="nowrap">(Book of Daniel 2-6.)</span></p>

<h3 id='OT46' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>46. The Return from Babylon</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Cyrus, king of Persia, took Babylon, and permitted
the Jews to return to the land of their fathers. He
gave them back all the vessels of gold and silver from
the temple that had been carried away by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Nebuchadnezzar. The 70 years were then at an end. Those who
went away were 42,360. Zerubbabel, a chief of the
house of David, led them to Jerusalem. In the second
year after their return they began to build a new temple
on Mount Moriah, where the temple of Solomon
had stood. The Samaritans wished to build the temple
with them; but the Jews would not permit it, as they
did not regard them as right brethren. The Samaritans
therefore hindered the work for many years. But
then the prophets Haggai and Zechariah arose and
encouraged the people, and the temple was finished;
but it was not so magnificent as Solomon’s temple.&#8212;The
Samaritans built a temple for themselves on
Mount Gerizim.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several years after this, Ezra, of the tribe of Levi,
came to Jerusalem and exhorted the people not to sin
any more against the Lord by marrying heathen
women. (Book of Ezra.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The walls of Jerusalem were not yet rebuilt. When
Nehemiah, cup-bearer to the king of Persia, heard of
this he begged leave to go to Judea. The king made
him governor of Judea, and he got the walls of the
city built in fifty-two days, even though the Samaritans
tried to hinder him. (Book of Nehemiah.)</p>

<h3 id='OT47' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>47. The Maccabees</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, took Palestine,
formerly belonging to the king of Persia, as
well as all the other kingdoms of the latter. When
Alexander died his great empire was divided, and the
Jews came first under Egypt and after that under
Syria and were oppressed in every way. At last the
Syrian king, Antiochus Epiphanes, sought to compel
them to live as the heathens. Many renounced their
faith and sacrificed to the gods. But many also continued
firmly in the faith and chose rather to die than
to turn from the law of the Lord. Seven brothers were
successively scourged and tormented to death. The
mother stood by and looked on and admonished them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>not to turn from the Lord. At last the mother also
was killed. <span class="nowrap">(2 Macc. 7.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>At this time there lived in Judea a priest by the
name of Mattathias. He would not sacrifice to the
idols, but fled with his sons to the mountains, and
those who feared God gathered about him. When he
died his son Judas Maccabaeus<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> became the leader.
He was brave as a young lion; he defeated the Syrians,
took Jerusalem and purged the temple.&#8212;The Maccabees
ruled over the country for 103 years. Then
the powerful Romans, whose home country was Italy,
came and conquered the country. The Roman emperor
Augustus made Herod king of Judea. Herod
who is called the Great, was an Edomite. He was
very suspicious and cruel and killed a great many
innocent people, even his own wife and three of his
sons. He wished to flatter the people, and decorated
the temple magnificently; but the people turned their
hearts from him.&#8212;During his reign the fulness of
time had come, and our Savior Jesus Christ was born
in Bethlehem, as the prophet Micah had foretold.</p>

<h3 id='OT48' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>48. Jonah</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Lord said unto the prophet Jonah: Go to Nineveh,
the great city, and proclaim that it shall be destroyed,
for its sins are great. But Jonah went aboard
a ship to flee over the sea. The Lord sent a tempest,
so the ship was at the point of sinking. The sailors
said one to another: Let us cast lots to see whose
fault it is that such evil befalls us. The lot fell on
Jonah, and they cast him into the sea; and it was
calm. The Lord sent a great fish that swallowed
Jonah, and he was in the belly of the fish for three
days and three nights. The Lord commanded the fish,
and it cast Jonah up on land. The Lord now spoke a
second time to Jonah: Go to Nineveh and proclaim
what I shall bid thee. Jonah went into Nineveh and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>cried: In 40 days Nineveh shall be destroyed! The
people repented, and the king put off his royal garments
and clothed himself in sack cloth and ashes.
God repented of the evil He had spoken, and He
spared Nineveh. Then Jonah murmured and said:
Did it not go as I thought while I was in my country,
and would flee over the sea? For I knew that Thou
art a God merciful and slow to anger, and repentest
of evil.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jonah had gone outside the city and remained there
to see what would become of the city. The Lord let
a plant spring up to give shade for his head, and
Jonah was fond of the plant. In the morning the Lord
prepared a worm, and it stung the plant, so it withered.
And there came a sultry east wind, and the sun
beat upon the head of Jonah, and he said: It is better
for me to die than to live. Then said the Lord: Thou
hast pity on the plant for which thou hast not labored,
neither madest it grow, because it withered; and
should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city,
wherein are more than twelve times 10,000 persons
that cannot discern between their right and their
left hand, and also much cattle? (The Book of
Jonah.)</p>

<h3 id='OT49' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-OT'>49. Job</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Job was the name of a God-fearing man who had
seven sons and three daughters, and owned 7,000
sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen and 500 she-asses,
and was the richest of all the men of the East.
When his sons had feasted and eaten and drunk, he
arose early and offered burnt offerings, for, said he:
It may be that my sons have sinned and said farewell
to God in their hearts. Eyes was he to the blind, feet
was he to the lame, and a father to the poor; the aged
arose before him, and princes were silent when he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day when his children were feasting in the
house of their elder brother, there came a messenger
to Job, and said: The oxen were plowing, and the asses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>were feeding beside them, and the Sabeans fell upon
them and took them away; yea, they have slain the
servants, I only am escaped. While he was yet speaking,
there came another and said: Fire is fallen from
heaven and has burned up the sheep and the shepherds,
and I only escaped. While he was yet speaking,
came a third and said: The Chaldeans fell upon the
camels, and have taken them away, yea, and have
slain the young men with the edge of the sword. I
only am escaped to tell thee. While he yet spoke,
came a fourth and said: Thy sons and daughters were
eating and drinking in their oldest brother’s house,
and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness,
and smote the house, and it fell upon thy children,
and they are dead, I only am escaped. Then
Job rent his robe, but worshiped God, and said: Naked
came I from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I
return. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away, blessed be the name of the Lord!</p>

<p class='c009'>Job’s whole body now became covered with boils,
and he took a potsherd to scrape himself, and he sat
in the ashes. His wife asked: Dost thou still believe
in God? Job answered: Thou speakest as one of the
foolish women. Shall we receive good at the hands of
God, and shall we not receive evil?</p>

<p class='c009'>Three of Job’s friends, hearing of his misfortunes,
came to console him. But they knew him not, and
they sat with him seven days and seven nights, and
none spake to him, for they saw that his grief was
very great. When they began to speak their words
were harsh, for they thought that he must be a greater
sinner than other men, since God sent greater afflictions
upon him than on others. Then Job sinned; for
he boasted of his perfection and disputed God’s righteousness.
Then the Lord spoke to Job out of a storm
and said: Who art thou, that durst dispute with God?
And Job answered: I have uttered that which I understood
not. And God forgave him, and reproved
his three friends because they had judged Job harshly.</p>

<p class='c009'>God blessed Job; he was healed again, and got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>twice as much riches as before; he got again seven
sons and three daughters, and lived a hundred and
forty years after and died old and full of days. (Book
of Job.)</p>

<p class='c009'>In most of these books prophecies concerning
Christ are found. Malachi, the last prophet, foretells
even of him who shall prepare the way for Him. The
Lord says in the book of this prophet: Behold, I will

me. And again He says: Behold, I will send you
Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great day

<p class='c009'>Concerning these writings the Apostle Paul says:
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is

Peter says: The holy men of God spoke as they were

<p class='c009'>After these books come a number of others called
Apocrypha. These were written by pious men and
contain much that is good; but they are not inspired
by God, as are the Holy Scriptures, hence we dare not
always use them as a lamp to our feet and a light to
our path. The most important are: The Book of

<p class='c008'>At the time that Herod the Great was king in
Judea, there was a priest by the name Zacharias, and
the name of his wife was Elisabeth. They were both
righteous before God; but they had no children, and
both were now old. One day while Zacharias was
offering incense in the Holy Place, and the people
were praying without, an angel of the Lord appeared
unto him. And fear fell upon Zacharias; but the
angel said unto him: Fear not, Zacharias, for thy
supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall
bear a son, and thou shalt call his name John<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. He
shall go before His face in the spirit and power of
Elijah, and make ready for the Lord a people prepared
for Him. Zacharias said: Whereby shall I
know this? The angel answered: I am Gabriel that
stand in the presence of God. Behold, thou shalt be
dumb until the day that these things shall come to
pass, because thou didst not believe my words. (Luke
1:5-25.)</p>

<p class='c009'>And Elisabeth brought forth a son. Her neighbors
and kinsfolk would have him called Zacharias after
his father; but his mother said: He shall be called
John. They said: There is none of thy kindred that
is called by this name. And they made signs to his
father, and he took a tablet and wrote: His name is
John. And immediately his mouth was opened, and
he blessed God in a glorious song of praise. And the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>child grew and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
deserts till the day when he stood forth before the
people of Israel. <span class="nowrap">(Luke 1:57-80.)</span></p>

<h3 id='NT52' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>52. The Annunciation of Mary</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>In the sixth month after Gabriel had appeared to
Zacharias he was sent from God to a city of Galilee
named Nazareth. There dwelt a virgin of the house
of David, and her name was Mary. She was betrothed
to a man of the house of David, and his name was
Joseph. And the angel came in unto Mary and said:
Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with
thee; blessed art thou among women! But Mary was
greatly troubled at this saying and cast in her mind
what manner of salutation this might be. And the
angel said: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor
with God. Thou shalt bring forth a son, and shalt call
his name JESUS.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Then Mary said: How shall this
be, seeing I am not married? The angel answered:
The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power
of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore
also the Holy One which is born of thee shall be called
the Son of God. And Mary said: Behold, the handmaid
of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy
word. And the angel departed from her. <span class="nowrap">(Luke 1:26-38.)</span></p>

<h3 id='NT53' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>53. The Birth of the Savior</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>It came to pass in those days that a decree went
out from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should
be enrolled. And all went to enroll themselves, every
one in his own city. And Joseph also went from Nazareth
in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David which is
called Bethlehem, to enroll himself with Mary, his
betrothed wife. While they were there, the time was
fulfilled, and Mary brought forth a son, wrapped Him
in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger, for
there was no room for them in the inn.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>And there were shepherds in the same country,
abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over
their flock. And lo, an angel of the Lord stood by
them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about
them, and they were sore afraid. But the angel said
unto them: Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy: For there is born to you this day
in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
And this is the sign unto you: Ye shall find a Babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude
of the heavenly host praising God, and saying: Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men
in whom He is well pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the shepherds came with haste and found
Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in the manger.
And they made known concerning the saying which
was spoken to them about this Child. And all that
heard it wondered; but Mary kept these words in her
heart. When eight days were fulfilled for circumcising
the Child, His name was called Jesus according
to the word of the angel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Forty days after the birth of Jesus, His parents
brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the
Lord. And there was in Jerusalem a pious man whose
name was Simeon. He had been promised by the
Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had
seen the Lord’s Christ. And he came that day in the
Spirit into the temple. And when he saw the Child,
he took It up in his arms and said: Lord, now lettest
Thou Thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have
seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before
the face of all peoples. <span class="nowrap">(Luke 2:1-31.)</span></p>

<h3 id='NT54' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>54. The Wise-Men from the East</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the days of
Herod the king, Wise-men came from the East to
Jerusalem, saying: Where is He that is born King of
the Jews? For we saw His star in the East, and are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>come to worship Him. And Herod called together the
chief priests and the scribes and inquired of them
where Christ should be born. They answered: In
Bethlehem, according to the prophecy of Micah. Then
Herod called the Wise-men secretly and learned of
them carefully what time the star appeared, and said
to them: Go to Bethlehem and search out carefully
concerning the Child, and when ye have found It,
bring me word, that I may come also and worship It.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Wise-men went their way, and lo, the star
which they had seen in the East went before them, till
it came and stood over the house where the Child was.
And when they saw the star they rejoiced greatly
and came into the house and found the Child and
Mary His mother, and they fell down and worshiped
Him, and they offered unto Him their treasures, gold,
frankincense and myrrh. And being warned of God in
a dream that they should not return to Herod, they
departed into their own country another way.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they were departed an angel of the Lord
appeared unto Joseph in a dream and said: Arise,
take the Child and His mother and flee into Egypt,
and be thou there until I tell thee; for Herod will seek
the Child to destroy Him. Then Joseph took the
Child and His mother by night and went into Egypt.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Herod saw that he was mocked of the Wise-men
he was exceeding wroth, and sent forth and slew
all the male children in Bethlehem from two years old
and under.&#8212;When Herod was dead an angel of the
Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying:
Arise, take the Child and His mother and go into the
land of Israel, for they are dead that sought the
Child’s life. And he went into Galilee and dwelt in
Nazareth. And the Child grew and waxed strong in
spirit, becoming full of wisdom; and the grace of God
was upon Him. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 2; Luke 2:39-40.)</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The parents of Jesus went every year to Jerusalem
at the feast of the Passover. When Jesus was twelve
years old, they took Him with them. When they went
home, He tarried behind in Jerusalem, and they knew
it not, but supposing Him to be in the company, they
went a day’s journey. And they sought for Him
among their kinsfolk and acquaintances. And when
they found Him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking
for Him. After three days they found Him in the
temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing
them and asking them questions. And all that heard
Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.
And Mary said: Son, why hast Thou thus
dealt with us? Thy father and I sought Thee sorrowing.
Jesus answered: How is it that ye sought me?
Knew ye not that I must be in my Father’s house?
And He went down with them to Nazareth; and He
was obedient to them.&#8212;And Jesus advanced in wisdom
and stature, and in favor with God and men

of Heaven is at hand. Even now the axe lieth at the
root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not
forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
His manner of living was like that of the prophets of
old; he had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern
girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and
wild honey. People both from Jerusalem and from
the country came to him, and they were baptized of
him, confessing their sins. Many believed that he
was Christ; but he said: I am not Christ. I baptize
only with water; but after me cometh One that is
greater than I, the latchet of whose shoe I am not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>worthy to unloose. He shall baptize with the Holy
Spirit. He is the Lamb of God that beareth the sins
of the world. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 3:1-11; John 1:19-29.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>John exhorted both high and low to repentance.
The tetrarch Herod Antipas had compelled his brother
to part from his wife, Herodias, and had himself taken
her to wife. John said to him: It is not lawful for thee
to have her. Herod became angry for this, and cast
John into prison. When Herod’s birthday came, the
daughter of Herodias danced before him; he was
pleased with the dance, and promised with an oath to
give her whatsoever she should ask, even the half of
his kingdom. She went to the mother, who said: Ask
for the head of John on a platter. The king was
grieved, but for the sake of his guests he kept his
word. John was beheaded, and his head was brought
to the princess on a platter. And his disciples came
and buried him. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 14:1-12.)</span></p>

<h3 id='NT57' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>57. Jesus Is Baptized</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When Jesus was thirty years old, He came to John
at the Jordan to be baptized. John said: I have need
to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?
Jesus answered: Suffer it now; for thus it becometh
us to fulfill all righteousness. Then John baptized
Him. And when Jesus went up from the water, lo, the
heavens were opened, and the Spirit of God descended
on Him in the form of a dove, and there came a voice
out of the heavens, saying: This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 3:13-17.)</span></p>

<h3 id='NT58' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>58. Jesus Is Tempted</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Then Jesus was led of the Spirit into the wilderness
to be tempted of the devil. And when He had
fasted forty days and forty nights, He afterward hungered.
And the tempter came and said unto Him: If
Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones
become bread. Jesus answered: It is written: Man
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil
took Him into the holy city, and he set him on the
pinnacle of the temple and said: If Thou art the Son
of God, cast Thyself down; for it is written: He shall
give His angels charge concerning Thee, and on their
hands they shall bear Thee up, lest haply Thou dash
Thy foot against a stone. Jesus answered: Again it
is written: Thou shalt not try the Lord thy God.
Again the devil took Him unto an exceeding high
mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the
world and the glory of them, and said: All these
things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and
worship me. Jesus answered: Get thee hence, Satan!
For it is written: Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy
God, and Him only shalt thou serve. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 4:1-11.)</span></p>

<h3 id='NT59' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>59. Jesus Begins His Work</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>After Jesus had been baptized and tempted He began
His work. For about three years He went from
place to place in the country and in the cities; and for
the great feasts He went up to Jerusalem. He spoke
but a word and the blind saw, the deaf heard, the lame
walked, the lepers were cleansed, and the dead were
raised. He was God’s only begotten Son, born of the
Father from eternity; therefore He could say: I am
the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man cometh
to the Father but by me. Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Everywhere the people flocked to Him and heard Him,
for as He spoke had no man spoken.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once He spoke to the people from a mountain.
This speech is therefore called the Sermon on the
Mount. In this He says:</p>

<p class='c009'>I am not come to destroy the law and the prophets,
but to fulfill them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ye have heard that it was said: Thou shalt not
commit adultery; but I say unto you that every one
that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Ye have heard that it was said: Thou shalt not forswear
thyself; but I say unto you: Swear not at all,
but let your speech be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; and whatsoever
is more than these is of the evil.</p>

<p class='c009'>When ye pray ye shall not be as the hypocrites,
for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and
in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of
men. Verily, I say unto you, they have received their
reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into
thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray
to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who
seeth in secret shall recompense thee.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,
where moth and rust consume, and where thieves
break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
consume, and where thieves do not break through
nor steal: for where thy treasure is, there will thy
heart be also.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be not anxious for what ye shall eat, or for what ye
shall drink, nor for what ye shall put on. Behold the
birds of the heavens: they sow not, neither do they
reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father
feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than
they? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow!
They toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you
that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like one of these. Be not therefore anxious for the
morrow; for sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto
you, even so do ye also unto them. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 5-7.)</span></p>

<h3 id='NT60' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>60. Jesus Chooses Twelve Apostles</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>As Jesus stood by the lake of Gennesaret one day,
the people pressed upon Him to hear the Word of God.
He entered Simon Peter’s boat and taught the people
from there. When He had left speaking, He said unto
Peter: Put out into the deep, and let down your nets
for a draught. Peter answered: We toiled all night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and took nothing; but at Thy word I will let down the
nets. And they enclosed a great multitude of fishes,
and their nets were breaking. And they beckoned
unto James and John, who were in another boat; they
came, and they filled both the boats. When Peter
saw this, he fell down at the feet of Jesus and said:
Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord. But
Jesus said to him: Fear not, from henceforth thou
shalt catch men. And they brought the boats to land,
and left all and followed Him. <span class="nowrap">(Luke 5:1-11.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Many followed Jesus to hear the Gospel of salvation;
from these He chose twelve men who constantly
should be with Him; these He called apostles, that
is, messengers; for they should be His messengers
into all countries to testify about Him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The names of the twelve apostles are these: 1.
Simon, whom the Savior called Peter (that is: the
rock); 2. his brother Andrew; 3. James, the son of the
fisherman Zebedee; 4. his brother John, the disciple
whom Jesus loved; 5. Philip; 6. Bartholomew; 7.
Thomas; 8. Matthew; 9. James, son of Alpheus; 10.
Judas Thaddeus; 11. Simon Zelotes (that is: the zealous
one); and 12. Judas Iscariot, who betrayed the
Savior.</p>

<p class='c009'>These twelve He sent out on short journeys to proclaim
to the Jews that the Kingdom of Heaven was at
hand. Two and two went together. Later on He sent
out seventy disciples, who also went two and two, to
proclaim that the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand.
(Matt. 10:1-5; Luke 10:1.)</p>

<h3 id='NT61' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>61. Jesus and Nicodemus</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>One of the Pharisees, a member of the council,
was named Nicodemus. He came to Jesus by night
and said: Rabbi, we know that Thou art a teacher
come from God; for no man can do these signs that
Thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered:
Except a man be born anew he cannot see the Kingdom
of God. Nicodemus said: How can a man be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>born when he is old? He can not be born twice?
Jesus answered: Verily, verily, I say unto thee: Except
a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God. For that which
is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of
the Spirit is spirit. Nicodemus answered: How can
these things be? Jesus answered: Art thou the teacher
of Israel, and understandest not these things? As
Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of Man be lifted up on the cross. For
God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should
not perish, but have eternal life. <span class="nowrap">(John 3:1-16.)</span></p>

<h3 id='NT62' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-NT'>62. Jesus and the Woman of Samaria</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Jesus was passing through Samaria, and being
wearied with His journey, He sat by the well outside
of the city of Sychar. A woman from the city came
to draw water. Jesus said unto her: Give me to drink.
She answered: How is it that Thou, being a Jew,
askest drink of me, being a Samaritan woman? For
there was bitter enmity between the Jews and the
Samaritans. Jesus said: If thou knew who it is that
speaketh with thee, thou wouldest have asked Him to
give thee to drink, and He would have given thee living
water. She answered: Sir, Thou hast nothing to
draw with, and the well is deep. Jesus said: Go, call
thy husband. She answered: I have no husband.
Jesus answered: Thou saidst well: I have no husband;
for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou
now hast is not thy husband. The woman said: Sir,
I perceive that Thou art a prophet. Where ought we
to worship God? We Samaritans believe it must be
done on Mount Gerizim, and ye Jews say: It ought to
be in Jerusalem. Jesus said: Woman, the hour cometh
when no man shall ask about Gerizim and Jerusalem;
for God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must
worship in spirit and truth. The woman answered:
When Messiah cometh He will declare unto us all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>things. Jesus said: I am Messiah. So the woman
left her water pot, and went into the city and told
what had happened to her; and the men went out to
Jesus, and He abode two days in the city, and many
believed in Him. And they said to the woman: Now
we believe not because of thy speaking, for we have
heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the
Savior of the world. <span class="nowrap">(John 4:1-42.)</span></p>

<h3 id='PJ63' class='c007'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>63. The Sower</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>A sower went forth to sow, and as he sowed, some
seeds fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured
them. And some fell upon rocky places, where
they had not much earth; and straightway they sprang
up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when
the sun was risen, they were scorched and withered
away. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns
grew up and choked them. But some fell upon good
ground and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some
sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the disciples did not understand the meaning
of this parable, Jesus gave them this explanation:
The seed is the Word of God; when any one hears the
Word and does not understand it, then comes the evil
one and snatches away that which is sowed in his
heart. This is the seed sown by the wayside.&#8212;That
which fell upon rocky places is he that hears the
Word, and straightway with joy receives it; and when
tribulation and persecution arise because of the Word,
he straightway stumbles.&#8212;That which is sown among
thorns is he that hears the Word, and the care of the
world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word,
and it becomes unfruitful.&#8212;But that sown in the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>ground is he that hears the Word and keeps it in his
heart, and it bears fruit. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 13:1-23.)</span></p>

<h3 id='PJ64' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>64. The Tares Among the Wheat</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man
that sowed good seed in his field. But in the night an
enemy came, and sowed tares among the wheat.
When the seed sprang up, the tares appeared also.
And the servants went to the householder and said:
Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field?
Whence has it then tares? He answered: An enemy
has done this. The servants said: Wilt thou, then,
that we go and gather them up? He answered: Nay,
lest haply ye root up the wheat with them. Let both
grow together until harvest; then I will say to the
reapers: Gather up first the tares and bind them in
bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my
barn.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jesus has explained also this parable: He that
soweth the good seed is the Son of Man, and the field
is the world; the good seed is the children of the
kingdom, and the tares are the children of the evil
one; and the enemy that sowed the tares is the devil.
The harvest is the end of the world, and the servants
are the angels. As the tares are gathered up and
burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of the world.
Then shall the Son of Man send forth His angels, and
they shall gather the ungodly, and shall cast them
into the furnace of fire, there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. But the righteous shall shine forth
as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. (Matt.
13:24-43.)</p>

<h3 id='PJ65' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>65. The Good Samaritan</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>A lawyer came to Jesus and said: Master, what
shall I do to inherit eternal life? Jesus said: What is
written in the law? He answered; Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>thy neighbor as thyself. Jesus said: Thou hast answered
right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he,
desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus: Who is my
neighbor? Jesus answered: A man was going down
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers,
who both stripped him and beat him, and departed,
leaving him half dead. And by chance a certain priest
was going down that way, and he saw him, but passed
by on the other side. A Levite did the same thing.
But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where
he was; and when he saw him, he was moved with
compassion. And he went to him, bound up his
wounds, pouring on them oil and wine. And he set
him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn and
took care of him. And on the morrow when he left,
he took out two pieces of money, gave them to the
host and said: Take care of him, and whatsoever thou
spendest more I will repay thee when I come back
again.&#8212;Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved
neighbor to him that fell among the robbers? And he
said: He that showed mercy on him. Jesus said: Go,
and do thou likewise. <span class="nowrap">(Luke 10:25-37.)</span></p>

<h3 id='PJ66' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>66. The Rich Man</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The ground of a certain rich man brought forth
plentifully. And he reasoned within himself: What
shall I do, because I have not room to bestow my
fruit? And he said: This will I do: I will pull down
my barns and build them greater, and there will I
bestow all my grain and goods. And I will say to my
soul: Soul, take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry! But
God said unto him: Thou fool, this night is thy soul
required of thee, and whose shall those things be
which thou hast prepared? <span class="nowrap">(Luke 12:16-20.)</span></p>

<h3 id='PJ67' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>67. The Fig Tree</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard;
and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found
none. Then he said to the vinedresser: Behold, these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and
find none. Cut it down! Why shall it take the
strength from the ground to no use? But the vinedresser
answered: Lord, let it alone this year also, till
I dig about it and dung it; perhaps it may then bear
fruit; if not, thou shalt cut it down. <span class="nowrap">(Luke 13:6-9.)</span></p>

<h3 id='PJ68' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>68. The Unmerciful Fellow-Servant</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Peter once asked Jesus: How often shall I forgive
my brother that sins against me? Are seven times
enough? Jesus answered: Not seven times, but seventy
times seven. And He told the following parable:
A king would make reckoning with his servants, and
there came one that owed him ten thousand talents.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
But as he had not wherewith to pay, the king commanded
that he and his wife and children and all that
he had should be sold, and payment be made. The
servant therefore fell down before him and said: Lord,
have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And
his lord, being moved with compassion, forgave him
the debt. But that servant went out, and found one
of his fellow-servants that owed him a hundred shillings,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
and he laid hold on him and took him by the
throat, saying: Pay me what thou owest! So his
fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying:
Have patience with me, and I will pay thee. And he
would not, but went and cast him into prison. So
when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they
were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their
lord all that was done. Then his lord called him and
said: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that
debt, because thou besoughtest me; shouldest not thou
also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I
had mercy on thee? And his lord cast him into prison,
till he should pay all that was due. So shall also my
heavenly Father do unto you, if you forgive not every
one his brother from your hearts. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 18:21-35.)</span></p>

  <h3 id='PJ69' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>69. The Prodigal Son. The Lost Sheep</a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Pharisees considered themselves righteous,
and were therefore offended because Jesus received
publicans and sinners and ate with them. Jesus therefore
spoke the following parables: A certain man had
two sons. The younger said to the father: Father,
give me that part of thy substance that falls to me.
And he divided unto them. Not many days after, the
younger son gathered all his goods and took his
journey into a far country, and there he wasted his
substance in riotous living. And when he had spent
all, there arose a mighty famine in that country, and
he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself
to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent
him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain
have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate;
and no man gave him anything. When he came to
himself he said: How many hired servants of my
father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish
here with hunger! I will arise and go to my father,
and will say unto him: Father, I have sinned against
heaven and in thy sight. I am no more worthy to be
called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
And he arose and came to his father. While he was
yet far off, his father saw him and was moved with
compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed
him. The son said: Father, I have sinned against
heaven and in thy sight; I am no more worthy to be
called thy son. But the father said to his servants:
Bring forth the best robe, and put a ring on his hand,
and shoes on his feet, and kill the fatted calf, and let
us eat and make merry. For this my son was dead,
and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elder son was in the fields, and as he came
home and heard music and dancing, he asked one of
the servants what these things might be. And he was
told that the father had made a feast for his son who
had returned. Then he was angry, and would not go
in. His father came out and entreated him; but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>answered: Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and
I never transgressed thy commandments, and yet thou
never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with
my friends; but when this thy son came, who hath
devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him
the fatted calf. But his father said: My son, thou
art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine; but it
was meet to make merry and be glad, for this thy
brother was dead, and is alive; and was lost, and is
found.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a man has a hundred sheep and loses one of
them, does he not leave the ninety and nine, and go
after the lost sheep? And when he hath found it, he
lays it on his shoulders and bears it home, and rejoices
more over that one than over the ninety and
nine which were not lost. So shall there be greater
joy in heaven over one sinner who repenteth, than
over ninety and nine who need no repentance. (Luke
15.)</p>

<h3 id='PJ70' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>70. The Rich Man and Lazarus</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>There was a rich man, and he was clothed in
purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every
day. But there was a poor man named Lazarus, that
was laid at his gate, full of sores, and he desired to be
fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s
table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
The poor man died, and he was carried away by the
angels into Abraham’s bosom. The rich man died
also, and was buried. When he lifted up his eyes in
hell, being in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and
Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said: Father
Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that
he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my
tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame. But Abraham
answered: Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
hast received thy good things, and Lazarus likewise
evil things; but now here he is comforted, and
thou art in anguish. Besides all this, between us and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>you there is a great gulf fixed, that they who would
pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none
may cross over from thence to us. And he said: I
pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send
him to my father’s house&#8212;for I have five brothers&#8212;that
he may testify unto them, lest they also come into
this place of torment. Abraham answered: They have
Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. But he
said: Nay, Father Abraham; but if one go to them
from the dead they will repent. Abraham answered:
If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be persuaded if one rise from the dead. (Luke
16:19-31.)</p>

<h3 id='PJ71' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>71. The Pharisee and the Publican</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>To certain who trusted in themselves that they
were righteous, and set all others at naught, Jesus
spake this parable: Two men went up into the temple
to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed thus: God,
I thank Thee, that I am not as the rest of men&#8212;extortioners,
unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
I fast twice in the week, and give tithes of all that I
get. But the publican, standing afar off, would not
lift his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast and
said: God, be merciful to me a sinner! I say unto you:
This man went down to his house justified, but not the
Pharisee; for every one that exalteth himself shall be
humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
(Luke 18:9-14.)</p>

<h3 id='PJ72' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>72. The Laborers in the Vineyard</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Kingdom of Heaven is like a householder who
went out early in the morning to hire laborers into
his vineyard. And when he had agreed with them for
a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And
he went out about the third hour, and saw others
standing in the marketplace idle, and said to them:
Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>I will give you. Again he went out about the sixth
and about the ninth hour and did likewise. And
about the eleventh hour he went out again and found
others standing, and he said: Why stand ye here all
the day idle? They said: Because no man hired us.
He said unto them: Go ye also into the vineyard, and
whatsoever is right I will give you. When even was
come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward:
Call the laborers, and pay them their hire, beginning
from the last unto the first. They that were hired
about the eleventh hour came and received every man
a shilling. And when the first came, they supposed
that they would receive more; and they likewise received
every man a shilling. Then they murmured
against the householder and said: These last have
spent but one hour, and thou hast made them equal
to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the
scorching heat. He answered: Friend, I do thee no
wrong. Didst thou not agree with me for a shilling?
Take up that which is thine, and go thy way. But I
will give the last as much as thee. Is it not lawful
for me to do what I will with mine own? Or doth it
hurt thee that I am good? <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 20:1-15.)</span></p>

<h3 id='PJ73' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>73. The Marriage of the King’s Son</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a certain
king who made a marriage feast for his son. He sent
his servants forth to call them that were bidden to the
marriage feast. But they would not come, but went
their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise,
and the rest laid hold on his servants and treated
them shamefully and killed them. But the king was
wroth, and he sent his armies and destroyed those
murderers and burned their city. And he said to his
servants: The wedding is ready; but they that were
bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore to the crossroads,
and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage
feast. And the wedding was filled with guests.
When the king went in to behold the guests, he saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>one who had not on a wedding garment. And he said
to him: Friend, how comest thou in hither, not having
a wedding garment? But he was silent. Then the
king said to the servants: Bind him hand and foot, and
cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 22:1-13.)</span></p>

<h3 id='PJ74' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-PJ'>74. The Talents</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>A man going into another country called his servants
and delivered unto them his goods. To one he
gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another
one talent. After a long time the lord of those
servants came home, and made a reckoning with them.
He that received five talents came and said: Lord,
thou gavest me five talents; lo, I have gained other
five talents. His lord said unto him: Well done, good
and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a
few things, I will set thee over many things; enter
thou into the joy of thy lord. Likewise he said to the
servant who received two talents and with them
gained two other talents. Then came also the one
that had received the one talent and said: Lord, I
knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where
thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst
not scatter. Therefore I was afraid, and went away
and hid thy talent in the earth; lo, here it is. His lord
said: Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest
that I am a hard man; thou oughtest therefore to have
put my money to the bankers, so I could have received
back mine own with interest. And he commanded
that the unprofitable servant be cast out where there
is weeping and gnashing of teeth. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 25:14-30.)</span></p>

<p class='c008'>There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the
mother of Jesus was there, and Jesus and His disciples
were also invited. And when the wine failed, the
mother of Jesus said unto Him: They have no more
wine. Jesus answered: Woman, what have I to do
with thee? Mine hour is not yet come. His mother
said to the servants: Whatsoever He saith to you, do
it. The Jews always washed their hands before meals,
and six water-pots of stone stood there for washing.
Jesus said to the servants: Fill the water-pots with
water. And they filled them up to the brim. And He
said unto them: Draw out now, and bear unto the
steward of the feast. The steward knew not whence
the wine was. When he tasted it, he said to the bridegroom:
Every man setteth on first good wine, then
that which is worse; thou hast kept the good wine
until now. This beginning of His signs did Jesus in
Cana in Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His

was in the stern of the boat asleep. And the disciples
went to Him and awoke Him and said: Save, Lord,

on her and said: Weep not. And He came nigh and
touched the bier, and the bearers stood still, and He
said: Young man, I say unto thee: Arise! And he

some came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue
and said: Why troublest thou the Master any

father: Fear not, only believe, and she will be saved.
When He came in, He beheld a tumult, and many
weeping. But He said: Weep not! And He took the

day is now far spent; send the people away, that they
may go to the villages round about and buy themselves
food. Jesus answered: Give ye them to eat.
They said: We have five loaves of bread and two

let the people sit down on the grass, took the five
loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven,
He blessed, and brake them and gave them to the
disciples, and the disciples set before them. And they

One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned
back, glorifying God with a loud voice. And he fell
upon his face at the feet of Jesus and gave Him thanks.
And he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus said: Were not

<h3 id='MJ82' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-MJ'>82. Jesus Raises Lazarus from the Dead</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Near Jerusalem was a little village called Bethany.
There dwelt a man named Lazarus and his two sisters,
Martha and Mary. And Jesus loved them very
much. Once when Lazarus was sick, the sisters sent
word to Jesus, saying: Lord, he whom Thou lovest is
sick. Jesus was at that time on the other side of the
Jordan, and He remained there two days. Afterward
He said to His disciples: Our friend Lazarus sleepeth;
but I go that I may awake him out of sleep. The disciples
answered: If he is fallen asleep, he will recover.
Jesus now said plainly: Lazarus is dead. When Jesus
came to Bethany, Lazarus had been in the tomb four
days. Martha heard that Jesus was coming, and went
to meet Him and said: Lord, if Thou hadst been here
my brother had not died. Jesus answered: Thy
brother shall rise again. I am the resurrection and the
life; he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall
he live. Mary then came out also to Jesus and said:
Lord, if Thou hadst been here my brother had not
died. When Jesus therefore saw both her and the
Jews that came with her, weeping, He said: Where
have ye laid him? They answered; Come and see.
Jesus wept. The Jews then said: Behold, how He
loved him! They now came to the tomb, which was
a cave, and a stone lay against it. Jesus said: Take
away the stone! Martha saith unto Him: Lord, he
stinketh by this time; for he hath been four days in

if thou couldest believe thou shouldest see the glory
of God? When they had removed the stone Jesus
lifted up His eyes and gave thanks to the Father who
always heard Him, and then He cried with a loud
voice: Lazarus, come forth! And he that was dead
came forth in the grave-clothes. And many of the

<p class='c008'>Jesus oftentimes prayed. Once, when He had ended
His prayer, one of the disciples said: Lord, teach us
to pray, as John the Baptist taught his disciples to
pray. Jesus answered: When ye pray, ye shall say:</p>

<p class='c009'>Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy

<p class='c008'>Jesus took Peter, James and John with Him and
went up into a high mountain to pray. And as He
was praying, He was transfigured before them, and
His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became
white as snow. And they saw Moses and Elijah,
who spoke with Him about His sufferings and death,
which awaited Him in Jerusalem. Peter said: Lord,
it is good for us to be here. If Thou wilt we will make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>three tabernacles, one for Thee, one for Moses and
one for Elijah. While he was yet speaking, a bright
cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of
the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased; hear ye Him. And when the disciples
heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore
afraid. But Jesus came and touched them and said:
Arise, and be not afraid. And lifting up their eyes,
they saw no one, save Jesus only. (Matt. 17:1-8;

Zaccheus; he was the chief publican in Jericho and
was very rich. He was anxious to see Jesus, but could
not for the people, as he was small of stature. He
therefore ran on before, and climbed up in a tree.
When Jesus came to the place and saw him He said:
Zaccheus, make haste and come down, for today I
must abide at thy house. And Zaccheus made haste
and received Him with joy. But those who saw it
murmured, saying: He is gone in to lodge with a
sinful man! Zaccheus said to the Lord: Behold, half
of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully
exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold.
And Jesus answered him: The Son of Man is come
to seek and to save that which was lost. (Luke 19:

</div>

<p class='c008'>The Pharisees were outwardly blameless, and for a
show made long prayers; but in secret they robbed
widows of their property. They were like graves, outwardly
whitened, but inwardly full of dead men’s
bones and all uncleanness. Jesus told them these
things openly, and they therefore became His enemies;
for man does not wish that his evil works shall
come to the light.&#8212;They believed that they for the
sake of their righteousness should inherit the kingdom
of God; but Jesus preached conversion and faith, and
said that publicans and sinners would go into the
Kingdom of Heaven before them. The Pharisees
wished to be greeted in the market-places and be
called Rabbi, and they were envious, for the multitude
clung to Jesus because of His blessed words
and His miracles. They would not understand Moses
and the prophets, and expected that the Messiah
should establish the kingdom of David again, and
bring the Romans and other nations under the Jews.
Jesus said that His kingdom was not of this world,
and that He should be persecuted and crucified, and
on the third day arise again from the dead. For all
these things the Pharisees and priests hated Jesus, and
took counsel how they could kill Him. Man always
finds an excuse. The high priest Caiaphas said: It is
better that one man die for the people, than that the
whole nation should be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sadducees taught that there is no resurrection
from the dead, and they therefore held the doctrine of
Jesus concerning resurrection and final judgment in
derision and gave not the Word room in their hearts.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Palm Sunday, which is the Sunday before
Easter, Jesus rode from Bethany on the other side of
the Mount of Olives into Jerusalem on a young ass.
This came to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the prophet Zechariah: Tell ye the daughter
of Zion: Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek and
riding upon the foal of an ass. Many of the people
cut branches from the palm trees and spread them in
the way, and the most part spread their garments in
the way and cried, saying: Hosanna<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> to the Son of
David; Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p class='c009'>And when He drew nigh and saw the city, He
wept over it, saying: If thou hadst known, even in this
thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!
But now they are hid from thine eyes. Therefore the
days shall come when thine enemies shall compass
thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and shall
dash thee to the ground, and they shall not leave in
thee one stone upon another, because thou knowest
not the time of thy visitation. And He entered into
the city and went to the court of the temple, and
healed the blind and the lame that came to Him.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the evening He went out to Bethany, and every
day He came into the temple and was teaching, and
the people hung upon Him, listening. The priests and
the scribes came together at the palace of Caiaphas,
and consulted how they might by craft take Jesus. And
Judas Iscariot came to them and said: What will ye
give me, and I will deliver Him unto you? And they
gave him thirty pieces of silver. And from that time
he sought opportunity to betray his Lord. (Matt.

<p class='c008'>In the evening of Maundy Thursday Jesus sat
down with His disciples to eat the Passover. As they
were eating Jesus said: One of you shall betray me.
The disciples looked sorrowfully upon one another,
to know who was meant. Peter beckoned to John,
who was reclining toward the breast of Jesus, that he
should ask. Jesus answered: It is he to whom I give
this morsel which I now dip in the dish. And He
gave the morsel to Judas, saying: What thou doest,
do quickly! The disciples understood not what Jesus
meant; but Judas went out straightway to the priests.
And it was night.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Jesus took the bread, gave thanks, and broke
it, gave His disciples and said: Take, eat! this is my
Body which is given for you. This do in remembrance
of me!</p>

<p class='c009'>In like manner He also took the cup, after supper,
saying: Drink ye all of it! This cup is the new covenant
in my Blood, which is shed for you for the remission
of sins. This do, as often as ye drink it, in
remembrance of me!</p>

<p class='c009'>Jesus then said: I have yet much to say unto you,
but ye can not bear it now. But the Comforter, the
Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
He shall teach you all things, and remind you of all
things which I have said unto you. (Matt. 26:26-29;

<h3 id='LD90' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>90. Jesus in Gethsemane</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Jesus thereupon went with the eleven disciples
over the brook Kidron to the Mount of Olives; there
was a garden called Gethsemane. In the way He said:
All of you shall be offended because of me this night.
Peter said: Even if all shall be offended, yet will not
I be offended. Jesus answered: Before the cock crows
twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they came to the place, Jesus said to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>disciples: Remain ye here, while I go yonder and
pray. And He took with Him Peter, James and John
farther into the garden and said to them: Abide here,
and watch with me! And he went away as far as a
stone’s cast, fell upon His face and said: My Father,
if it be possible, then take this cup from me! Nevertheless,
not as I will but as Thou wilt!</p>

<p class='c009'>And He came to the three disciples and found
them sleeping. Then He said unto Peter: Could ye
not watch one hour with me? Watch and pray, that
ye enter not into temptation! Again He went away
and prayed the same prayer, and thus three times;
and while He suffered the agony of death His sweat
became as it were great drops of blood falling on the
ground. And there appeared to Him an angel from
heaven, strengthening Him. And when He rose up
from His prayer, He came to His disciples and said
unto them: The hour is at hand, and the Son of Man
is betrayed into the hands of sinners; he that betrayeth
me is near.</p>

<p class='c009'>And while He yet spake Judas came with a band
of soldiers and the servants of the chief priests, having
weapons and torches. Judas had said: He whom I
shall kiss, that is He: take Him. And he went up to
Jesus and said: Hail, Master! And he kissed Him.
Jesus answered: Judas, betrayest thou the Son of
Man with a kiss? Then the band stepped forth and
laid hold on Jesus. But all the disciples forsook Him
and fled. (All the Gospels.)</p>

<h3 id='LD91' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>91. Jesus Before the Council</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Jesus was brought to Caiaphas, the high priest,
where the council was assembled. The council consisted
of the chief priests, scribes and elders of the
people, in all seventy-one members. They at first
sought to convict Jesus by false witnesses; but the
witnesses did not agree. Then the high priest arose
and said: I adjure Thee by the living God that Thou
tell us if Thou art Christ, the Son of God. Jesus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>answered: I am. Then the high priest rent his clothes
and said: He has blasphemed God. What further
need have we of witnesses? They all answered: He
is worthy of death. And the servants struck Him in
the face and mocked Him. (All the Gospels.)</p>

<h3 id='LD92' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>92. Peter’s Denial. The Suicide of Judas</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When Jesus had suffered them to take Him and
lead Him away, Peter had followed Him afar off and
had come into the court of the palace of the high
priest. A maid said to him: Art not thou one of this
Man’s disciples? He said: I know Him not. He
went over to the servants, who sat by the fire warming
themselves. Here another seeing him, said: This
man also was with Him. But Peter denied again.
Then a third one said: Verily, thou art one of them;
for thou art a Galilean, thy speech betrays thee. Then
Peter began to swear, saying: I know not this Man
ye speak of. Then the cock crowed, and at the same
time they brought Jesus through the court, and He
turned and looked on Peter. And Peter remembered
the Savior’s words, and he went out and wept bitterly.
(All the Gospels.)</p>

<p class='c009'>When Judas saw that Jesus was condemned to
death, he regretted what he had done, and came to
the priests with the thirty pieces of silver and said:
I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But
they answered: What is that to us? See thou to it.
And he cast the pieces of silver into the temple, and
went and hanged himself, and falling headlong his
bowels gushed out. <span class="nowrap">(Matt. 27:3-5; Acts 1:18.)</span></p>

<h3 id='LD93' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>93. Jesus before Pilate</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Early in the morning of the day afterwards called
Good Friday the Jews brought Jesus from Caiaphas
to the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, to have the
sentence of death confirmed. Not wishing to defile
themselves, the Jews kept outside of the hall of judgment,
and Pilate came out to them and asked: What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>accusation bring ye against this Man? They answered:
He perverts the people and forbids paying
tribute to Caesar, and calls Himself Christ, a King.
Pilate took him into the hall of judgment and asked:
Art Thou a King? Jesus answered: I am King; but
my kingdom is not of this world; for then my servants
would have fought for me. I came into the
world to bear witness unto the truth. Every one
who is of the truth heareth my voice. Pilate perceived
that Jesus was innocent and would gladly have
set Him free; but he feared the priests and the
scribes, therefore he dared not do it openly, but went
out to the people and said: Ye have a custom that I
should release a prisoner at the Passover. Whom
will ye have, Jesus or Barabbas? The priests stirred
up the people against Jesus, and they cried: Away
with Him! But give us Barabbas. Now, Barabbas
was a murderer and robber.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pilate then, hoping to excite the pity of the people,
delivered Jesus to the soldiers to be scourged.
And the soldiers stripped off His clothes and scourged
Him; then they threw around Him a purple robe, put
a reed in His hand and a crown of thorns upon His
head, and fell down before Him and shouted: Hail,
Thou King of the Jews! And they struck Him on
the head with the reed. And Pilate brought Him out
to the people and said: Behold the Man! But the
Jews cried: Crucify Him, crucify Him! Pilate still
sought to set Him free, but they cried: If thou release
this Man, thou art not Caesar’s friend! Then Pilate
took water and washed his hands before the people
and said: I am innocent of the blood of this righteous
Man! They said: His blood be upon us and upon our
children! Then he delivered Jesus to be crucified.
(All the Gospels.)</p>

<h3 id='LD94' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>94. Jesus on the Cross</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>They now led Jesus out of the city to a place
called Golgotha, to crucify Him. And He bore the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>cross Himself. Many weeping women followed Him,
and Jesus turned to them and said: Weep not for me;
but weep for yourselves and for your children!</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the cross was written: JESUS OF NAZARETH,
KING OF THE JEWS. It was about nine
o’clock in the forenoon when they crucified Him.
Two robbers were also crucified with Him, one on
His right and one on His left side.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Jesus was hanging on the cross He said:
(1) Father, forgive them; for they know not what
they do!&#8212;At the cross stood the mother of Jesus,
and the disciple that Jesus loved. Jesus said: (2)
Woman, behold thy Son! And to the disciple He
said: Behold thy mother! And from that hour the
disciple took her unto himself.&#8212;The soldiers and the
priests mocked Him. And one of the robbers said:
If thou art Christ, save Thyself and us! The other
robber said: We suffer what we have deserved, but
this Man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto
Jesus: Lord, remember me when Thou comest into
Thy kingdom! To him Jesus said: (3) Verily, today
thou shalt be with me in Paradise!&#8212;From twelve
o’clock there was darkness over the whole earth, until
three o’clock, when Jesus cried with a loud voice:
(4) My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&#8212;And
after that He cried: (5) I thirst! One of them
ran and filled a sponge with vinegar and gave Him
to drink.&#8212;Thereupon He said: (6) It is finished!&#8212;And
again He cried with a loud voice: (7) Father,
into Thy hands I commend my spirit! And having
said this, He bowed His head and gave up the ghost.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent,
and the tombs were opened, and the veil between the
Holy and the Holy of Holies in the temple was rent
in twain from the top to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c009'>That the bodies might be taken down from the
crosses before the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate that
their legs might be broken. The soldiers therefore
came and broke the legs of the two robbers; but when
they came to Jesus, they saw that He was dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>already, therefore they broke not His legs; but to make
sure one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear,
and there came out blood and water. (All the Gospels.)</p>

<h3 id='LD95' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>95. The Burial of Jesus</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the council,
who until now secretly had been a disciple of Jesus,
got permission from Pilate to take the body down
from the cross and bury it. And Nicodemus, the
same who came to Jesus by night, was with him, and
brought a hundred pounds of myrrh and aloes. They
anointed the body of Jesus and laid it in a sepulchre,
hewn in stone, near by Golgotha, and rolled a great
stone before the opening of the tomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate
and said: Sir, this Deceiver said, while He was yet
alive: After three days I rise again. Command therefore
that a guard be placed at the sepulchre, that His
disciples may not come and steal the body away and
say: He is risen. They received a guard, which they
placed at the tomb, and they sealed the stone. (All
the Gospels.)</p>

<h3 id='LD96' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>96. The Resurrection of Jesus</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Jesus was in the tomb until the third day, from
Friday evening till Sunday morning. Before the sun
rose on Sunday morning there was a great earthquake,
for an angel of the Lord came down from
heaven and rolled the stone from the tomb. Jesus
arose from the dead, and a great fear fell upon those
who stood guard, and they fled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early on the same Easter morn some women came
to the tomb to anoint the body of Jesus. In the way
they said to one another: Who shall roll us away the
stone from the tomb? When they came to the tomb,
they saw that the stone was rolled away. One of
the women, named Mary Magdalene, ran to Peter
and the disciple whom Jesus loved, and said: They
have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>know not where they have laid Him. The other
women went into the sepulchre, where an angel in
white raiment was sitting, and he said: Ye seek Jesus
of Nazareth. He is not here; He is risen.&#8212;When
they had left, Peter and John came to the tomb.
They went in and saw the linen clothes; but Him
they found not. And they went away again. Then
came Mary Magdalene again to the tomb, and stood
outside and wept. And Jesus appeared unto her and
said: Woman, why weepest thou? She knew Him
not, but supposed Him to be the gardener, and said:
Sir, if thou hast borne Him hence, tell me where thou
hast laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus said:
Mary! Then she knew Him and said: Master! Jesus
answered: Go unto my brethren and say to them:
I ascend to my Father and your Father! And she
came and told the disciples that she had seen the
Lord. (The Gospels.)</p>

<h3 id='LD97' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>97. Jesus Appears to His Disciples</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The same day two disciples were going from Jerusalem
to a village named Emmaus. And they communed
with each other of all those things which had
happened. Then Jesus Himself drew near and went
with them. He said: What are ye speaking about,
and why are ye looking so sad? They answered: Art
thou alone a stranger in Jerusalem, and knowest not
the things which are come to pass there in these days?
The chief priests and our rulers have crucified Jesus
of Nazareth. But He was a prophet mighty in deed
and word, and we hoped that it was He who should
redeem Israel. And this is now the third day since
these things came to pass. Moreover, certain women,
having been early at the tomb, came and told that the
tomb was empty, and that they had seen a vision of
angels, who said that He was alive. And certain disciples
went to the tomb, and found it even so as the
women had said; but Him they saw not. Jesus answered:
O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>what Moses and the prophets have said! Behooved it
not Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His
glory? And He interpreted to them all that was written
concerning Himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they drew nigh unto Emmaus, He made as
though He would go farther. And they constrained
Him, saying: Abide with us; for it is toward evening,
and the day is far spent. And He went in to abide
with them. But when He sat down with them to meat,
He took bread, blessed it, and broke it, and gave to
them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew
Him. But He vanished out of their sight. And they
said one to another: Was not our heart burning within
us while He spoke to us in the way, while He opened
to us the Scriptures? And they rose up that very hour
and returned to Jerusalem, and found the apostles
gathered together, and told them the things that happened
in the way, and how He was known of them in
the breaking of the bread. <span class="nowrap">(Luke 24:13-25.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>While they were speaking, Jesus stood in the midst
of them and said unto them: Peace be unto you! They
were terrified, for they knew Him not. But He
showed them His hands and His feet, and they were
glad.&#8212;But Thomas was not with them. When the
others said: We have seen the Lord, he said: Except
I shall put my finger in the print of the nails in His
hands, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.</p>

<p class='c009'>After eight days His disciples were again assembled,
and the doors were shut. Then Jesus again
stood in the midst of them and said: Peace be unto
you! Unto Thomas He said: See my hands, and
reach hither thy hand, and put it into my side, and be
no longer faithless, but believing! Thomas said: My
Lord and my God! Jesus answered: Because thou
hast seen me, thou hast believed: Blessed are they
that have not seen, and yet have believed. (John
20:19-29.)</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h3 id='LD98' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>98. The Ascension of Jesus</a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>During forty days Jesus showed Himself several
times to the apostles and spoke of the things pertaining
to the kingdom of God. He was also seen by
others, once by five hundred brethren. He showed
Himself to the eleven apostles on a mountain in Galilee,
and said: All authority hath been given unto me
in heaven and on earth. Go ye therefore, and make
disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even
unto the end of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Forty days after His resurrection, on the day afterwards
called Ascension Day, He appeared to them for
the last time. He led them out to the Mount of Olives,
and He lifted up His hands and blessed them; and
while He blessed them, He parted from them, and was
carried up into heaven; and a cloud received Him out
of their sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>And while they were looking into heaven, two men
stood by them in white apparel and said: Ye men of
Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? This
Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye beheld Him going
into heaven. (Matt. 28:16-20; Luke 24:50-51;
Acts 1:1-2.)</p>

<h3 id='LD99' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>99. Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>At His ascension Jesus had said to the apostles:
John baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
with the Holy Spirit, not many days hence. Until
this came to pass, they were to abide at Jerusalem.
On one of these days they chose one of the disciples
named Matthias to be apostle in the place of Judas.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the morning of the day of Pentecost, ten days
after the ascension, the apostles were assembled as
usual. And suddenly there came from heaven the
sound as of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>where they were sitting. And there appeared unto
them tongues as of fire, parting asunder; and it sat
upon each one of them. And they were all filled with
the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other
tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews from
every nation. When this sound was heard, they came
together and said: What is this? Are not all these
men Galileans? And how hear we then every man in
our own language speaking the mighty words of God?
But Peter, standing up, spake forth unto them saying:
Jesus of Nazareth, whom ye have crucified, sitteth
now at the right hand of God, and has poured out His
Holy Spirit. Now, when they heard this, they were
pricked in their heart and they said: What shall we
do? Peter answered: Repent ye, and be baptized in
the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your
sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
They then that received the word were baptized on
the same day, about three thousand souls.</p>

<p class='c009'>And all that believed were daily together in
prayer, and in breaking the bread in the Lord’s Supper.
They sold their possessions, and parted them to
all, according as any man had need. And day by day
the Lord added others to the congregation. (Acts 2.)</p>

<h3 id='LD100' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>100. The Apostles Before the Council</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Peter and John went up to the temple to pray. A
man that had been lame from his birth was sitting
outside the door asking alms. Peter said: Silver and
gold have I none; but what I have, that I give thee:
In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, arise and walk!
And immediately he leaped up, and entered with them
into the temple and praised God. And many were
baptized.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the priests and the scribes laid hands on the
apostles and took them before the council. And they
threatened them to preach no more in the name of
Jesus. But Peter and John answered: Judge ye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>whether it be right to hearken unto you rather than
unto God. Afterward they concluded to kill the apostles;
but Gamaliel, a Pharisee, who was held in honor
of all the people, arose and said unto them: Refrain
from these men, and let them alone: For if this counsel
be of men, it will be overthrown: but if it is of
God, ye will not be able to overthrow them. To him
they agreed, yet beat they the apostles, and charged
them not to speak in the name of Jesus. And the
apostles departed from the council, rejoicing that they
were counted worthy to suffer for the Name; and they
ceased not to preach Jesus Christ. <span class="nowrap">(Acts 3-5.)</span></p>

<h3 id='LD101' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>101. Stephen</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>When the congregation increased the apostles
said: Choose seven men as overseers for the poor, for
it is not fit that we should forsake the Word of God
and serve tables. And the congregation chose Stephen
and six others; and the apostles prayed and laid their
hands on them.&#8212;Stephen was full of faith and power
and wrought great wonders among the people. And
certain scribes arose and disputed with Stephen. And
they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the
spirit with which he spoke. Then they seized him
and brought him before the council, and they suborned
false witnesses, who said: We have heard him speak
blasphemous words against the temple and against
Moses. Stephen made a speech and showed that the
Jews had always resisted God. When they heard this,
they were enraged; but Stephen looked steadfastly up
into heaven and said: Behold, I see the heavens opened,
and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of
God. But they rushed upon him and cast him out of
the city and stoned him. But Stephen prayed: Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit. And he kneeled down and
cried with a loud voice: Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
Those who stoned Stephen laid down their garments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>at the feet of a young Pharisee named Saul. And
Saul was consenting unto his death. <span class="nowrap">(Acts 6-7.)</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Stephen is the first Christian martyr; martyrs, that
is, witnesses, are those who suffer death for the sake
of Christ.</p>

<h3 id='LD102' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>102. Cornelius</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Our Savior had said: Go and make disciples of all
nations. Still the apostles from the beginning preached
only to the Jews; for it was not yet clear to them that
heathens had the same access to the kingdom of God
as the Jews.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day, as Peter was sitting on the flat roof of a
house, praying, he saw a vision: He saw a vessel, like
a great sheet, come down from heaven, and in the
sheet were all kinds of unclean animals, and a voice
said to him: Rise, Peter; kill and eat. But Peter answered:
Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything
unclean. The voice said: What God hath cleansed,
make not thou unclean. And this was done thrice,
and the vessel was taken up to heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Peter was perplexed what the vision might
mean, messengers came from a heathen, Cornelius by
name. And Peter went with them, and preached to
Cornelius and his household. And while he was
preaching, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the
word. Then Peter said: Can any man forbid the water
that these should not be baptized that have received
the Holy Spirit, as well as we? And he commanded
that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
When the brethren in Jerusalem heard this, they said:
Then unto the gentiles also hath God granted repentance
unto life. <span class="nowrap">(Acts 10, 11:1-18.)</span></p>

<h3 id='LD103' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>103. Paul</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Saul was breathing threatening and slaughter
against the Christians, and received from the high
priest letters to go to Damascus and seize all them
that were of the Christian faith, both men and women,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and bring them bound to Jerusalem. When he drew
nigh unto Damascus, there suddenly shone round
about him a light from heaven. He fell upon the
earth and heard a voice, saying: Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me? I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.
It is hard for thee to kick against the goad! Saul
asked: What wilt thou, Lord, that I should do? The
Lord answered: Arise, and enter into the city, and it
shall be told thee what thou must do. Saul rose up;
he was blind, and had to be led by the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was in Damascus a Christian named Ananias.
The Lord said to him in a vision: Go to Saul
that he may receive his sight. Ananias answered:
I have heard of this man, how much evil he did to
Thy saints at Jerusalem, and to all that call upon Thy
name. The Lord said: Go; for he is a chosen vessel
unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and
kings and the children of Israel. And Ananias went,
and laid his hands upon him. And straightway there
fell as it were scales from his eyes, and he received his
sight and was baptized. And straightway in the synagogues
he proclaimed Jesus, that He is the Son of
God. Later on he was called Paul, and was acknowledged
by the other apostles as a fellow-apostle; and
by the grace of God he labored more than the other
apostles.</p>

<p class='c009'>He made three great journeys, going far abroad,
and is called the Apostle of the Gentiles. At Antioch
in Syria he preached for a whole year, and it was here
the believers were first called Christians. He proceeded
to Greece, Europe, and the Word made good
progress, and he strengthened the converts by the letters
he wrote to the churches.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Jews persecuted him in every place, and
when he, after his third journey, came to Jerusalem,
they laid hold on him and would kill him; but the
Roman governor sent him to Rome to be judged by
the emperor, to whom Paul had appealed; for he was
a Roman citizen. The emperor Nero acquitted him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>and it is told that he undertook a fourth missionary
journey. During his absence Nero began the first
great persecution against the Christians. When Paul
came back from his last journey, he was beheaded at
Rome, at the same time that Peter was crucified
(about sixty-seven years after the birth of Christ.)
(Acts 9, 13-28.)</p>

<h3 id='LD104' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>104. The Destruction of Jerusalem</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Lord had foretold that there should not be
left one stone upon another in Jerusalem. This was
fulfilled in this way: The Romans set cruel governors
over the country, and at last the Jews concluded that
it was better for all to die at once than to be killed
one by one. They revolted, and defended themselves
with great bravery. Titus, who later on became emperor,
came against Jerusalem with an army, and
surrounded the city on all sides. It was at the time
of the Passover, and a great multitude of Jews from
all countries had come to Jerusalem to keep the feast.
The famine became so terrible that a mother is said
to have slaughtered her own child for food. Over one
million of Jews are said to have perished during the
siege, and about one hundred thousand were taken
prisoners. Titus crucified multitudes of them, others
were sold into slavery, or made to fight with wild animals
for the amusement of the Romans. Titus had
commanded that the temple be spared; but a soldier
threw a firebrand into it, and it was consumed. This
happened about seventy years after the birth of Christ.&#8212;Josephus,
a leader of the Jews, has told about the
destruction of Jerusalem. He was taken prisoner and
was with Titus to the end of the war.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Christians believed the prophecy of the Lord
and left the city before Titus surrounded it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since that time the Jews have been scattered
through all lands. The Lord has promised that even
they once shall repent, and believe on Him, the crucified
Redeemer.</p>

  <h3 id='LD105' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-LD'>105. The Apostle John</a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Of all the other apostles it is stated that they suffered
martyrdom, except John, who died a natural
death in the city of Ephesus, one hundred years old;
and he thus survived the destruction of Jerusalem.
He was for some years exiled to the island of Patmos,
but was afterwards permitted to return to Ephesus.</p>

<p class='c009'>He has been called the Apostle of Love, as Paul has
been called the Apostle of Faith. It is told of John
that when he was very old, and could no longer walk
to the assemblies of the Christians he was carried
thither, and said each time only these words: My children,
love one another!</p>

</div>

<h3 id='HC1' class='c007'><a href='#TOC-HC'>1. Progress of Christianity. The Christians are Persecuted</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>At the time of Christ all the countries around the
Mediterranean Sea were ruled by the Roman emperor.
The Romans, and still more the Greeks, who
were subject to them, excelled all other peoples at that
time in science and arts. But they were heathens,
and did not know the true God. Many had, however,
lost faith in their own gods, and began to look about
for salvation elsewhere. And with these the Gospel
speedily found entrance. Paul had established Christian
congregations in Macedonia and Greece; and even
in Rome there was a large congregation. About one
hundred years after the death of Christ there were
congregations throughout the Roman empire. But
heathenism was still very powerful, and many ridiculed
the faith of the Christians, that One who had been
crucified should be the Savior of the world, and sit at
the right hand of God, and should return to judge the
quick and the dead. They did not confine themselves
to ridicule; many of the emperors permitted the Christians
to worship their Lord and Savior in peace; but
others persecuted them cruelly, as Nero had persecuted
them in the days of the apostles. For about two
hundred and fifty years the Christians were exposed
to persecutions, and many were those who suffered
death for Christ’s sake. Polycarp, who in his youth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>had heard the apostle John, was in his old age bishop
of Smyrna, in Asia Minor. He was brought before the
Roman governor, who promised him his liberty if he
would curse Christ. But he answered: Eighty and
six years have I served Him, and He never did me
aught but good; how can I then curse Him, my Lord
and my Savior? The governor threatened to cast
him before wild beasts. But Polycarp remained steadfast.
He was sentenced to be burned alive, and he
ascended the pyre, praising the Lord who found him
worthy to suffer the death of a martyr.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many both men and women remained steadfast
during the tortures. Many heathens who beheld this
were awakened to forsake their idols and believe on
that Lord who could inspire His believers with such
courage. And thus the persecutions served to open
many hearts for Christianity.</p>

<h3 id='HC2' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>2. Constantine the Great</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Constantine, who has been called the Great, became
emperor over the whole Roman empire in the
year of our Lord 323. He was friendly toward Christianity,
and proclaimed full religious liberty, so persecutions
now ceased in all Roman countries. On his
deathbed he confessed Christianity and was baptized.
In his time magnificent churches were erected, and
the clergy came to great influence and honor. Unfortunately
he gave the Church, and especially the clergy,
too many privileges, and helped to advance the power
of the bishops. In the course of time this became
more and more destructive to the Church.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the time of Constantine there arose in Alexandria,
in Egypt, a heretic by the name of Arius. He
taught that Christ was not from eternity, but had a
beginning, at the beginning of time, and was consequently
a creature. Alexander, the bishop of Arius,
defended the faith of the Church, that the Son was
true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and
One with the Father. Many took sides with Arius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and therefore Constantine called a council or synod
of the Church at Nice, in Asia Minor, in the year 325.
The Church had at that time eighteen hundred bishops.
Of these, three hundred and eighteen met.
Athanasius, who took the part of Alexander, especially
exerted a great influence on the meeting through his
clear exposition of the Word of God and by his great
gift as a speaker. After a discussion lasting two months
Arius was excommunicated from the Church as a
heretic teaching false doctrines. His doctrine nevertheless
found adherents for about three hundred years,
and even at the present time we meet with them. The
Church had to resist other heretics in subsequent
times.</p>

<h3 id='HC3' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>3. Mohammed</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Southeast of Palestine the large peninsula of Arabia
is situated. Here lived about the year 600 a man
named Mohammed. He was a merchant, who for the
sake of commerce visited many countries, and became
acquainted with both the Jewish and the Christian religion.
He was a clever man, and had great gifts as
a speaker. He determined to start a new religion,
composed partly of what he had heard and partly of
his own inventions. He pretended, perhaps imagined,
that the angel Gabriel had appeared to him in a cave,
and had instructed him what to teach. His chief
doctrine was: There is one God, and Mohammed is
his prophet. God had sent many prophets into the
world, such as Moses and Christ; but Mohammed
was the last and the greatest. He promised his followers
a paradise of sensual pleasures. There was at
this time a great deal of division in the Church, and
no single country was powerful enough to resist the
Arabians. At the time of Mohammed’s death he ruled
over all of Arabia; and his successors, called Caliphs,
conquered many countries in Asia and Africa, and
they nearly exterminated Christianity where they
came into power. The Arabians penetrated even into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Europe, and conquered Spain, where they existed for
about eight centuries.</p>

<p class='c009'>The teachings of Mohammed are contained in a
book called the Koran. His adherents are called Mohammedans.
The Turks are Mohammedans, but have
taken the power from the Arabians, and the sultan of
Turkey, residing in Constantinople, is the head of the
“faithful.”</p>

<h3 id='HC4' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>4. Introduction of Christianity in the North</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>While Christianity suffered such great losses in
Asia and Africa, it was spread by faithful workers over
the whole of Europe. A monk by the name of Ansgar,
afterward called Saint Ansgar, came from Germany
to Denmark in 826, and labored there and in Sweden
for the introduction of Christianity for forty years,
surrounded by many dangers. He has been called the
Apostle of the North. It took, however, a long time
before Christianity was firmly established in these
countries. In olden times the people of Norway, as
well as of Denmark and Sweden, were heathens; their
gods were called Asas. But at the time when Christianity
reached Norway, the faith in Odin and Thor
was not very firm. Many believed in nothing but
their own strength. It is thus told about King Harald
the Fairhaired, that he placed no trust in the Asas,
but “believed in that god who was the strongest, and
had made all and ruled over all.” The Northmen who
first heard anything about Christ were Vikings, who
sailed west and south on their robbing expeditions.
Some of these were baptized, many only in order to
receive the presents that were given those who were
baptized. But such Christianity as this had no power,
and we hear nothing of any efforts on their part to
spread it when they came home. The Norse chief,
Helge the Lean, who had been brought up in Ireland
in the Christian faith, and later resided in Iceland,
continued in his faith in Christ; but when he was on
the sea or in danger he turned to Thor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Haakon the Good, who in England had been
brought up in the Christian faith, wished to introduce
it into Norway, when he was made king. He even
got some priests from England and built some
churches; but the people of Trondhjem opposed his
efforts, and Haakon himself was forced to sacrifice to
the gods.</p>

<p class='c009'>Haakon the Earl was the last heathen ruler of
Norway. He believed so strongly in the power of the
old gods that during the battle with the Jomsvikings
he sacrificed his own son to obtain victory. In an
insurrection he was killed by his own slave, and Olav
Trygveson became king. He had accepted Christianity
during one of his sea expeditions, and had been
baptized. He was zealous for the progress of the
faith, and traveled through the country to Christianize
the people. Where this could not be accomplished
with leniency, force was employed. Several who resisted
baptism were tortured to death. He introduced
Christianity in Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland,
but did not reign long enough over Norway to accomplish
his purpose there. When he had reigned five
years, he fell in the battle at Svolder, in the year 1000.</p>

<p class='c009'>Olav Haraldson, afterwards known as Saint Olav,
introduced Christianity throughout Norway. On one
of his Viking expeditions he had been converted and
baptized. He was of an earnest character, and Christianity
made a deep impression on his mind. He resolved
to Christianize the whole country, and for that
reason went from one district to another, building
churches and installing priests.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to the custom of the times he often employed
cruel means. The people were provoked and
rose in rebellion, and Olav fled to Gardarike, or Russia.
From thence he returned after a time with an
army, and treated the people with great kindness, but
they met him with a superior force at Stiklestad,
where Olav was killed after a great slaughter, in the
year 1030. He had then been king for about sixteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>years.&#8212;Miracles were soon reported to have been
wrought by his corpse, and after a few years he was
canonized as a saint. His bones were put in a shrine,
which afterwards was placed on the altar of the cathedral
at Trondhjem, where they remained until the time
of the Reformation. Pilgrimages were made to this
relic from far and near; pilgrimages belonged to the
superstitions of the times.</p>

<h3 id='HC5' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>5. The Popes, The Monks</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The bishop of Rome soon became the most powerful
among the bishops and was called pope, that is,
papa (father). Some popes were pious, God-fearing
men, who were zealous for the advancement of God’s
kingdom on earth; others endeavored only to extend
their own power and importance; and some were
downright wicked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The popes claimed and claim to this day that they
are the representatives of Christ on earth. They made
the claim that Christ had placed Peter over the other
apostles and over the whole Christian Church. Furthermore,
that Peter was the first bishop in Rome,
and that his power was inherited by the following
bishops. As the vicegerents of Christ they, of course,
must be infallible in doctrine; but they have nevertheless
often advanced doctrines that were only human
opinions, and even in direct opposition to the Scriptures.
They established the doctrine to worship the
virgin Mary and other dead men and women, and
canonized them as saints. They claimed that these
saints prevailed greatly with God, and therefore prayers
must be offered to them for intercession and help.
These saints were said through works of penitence and
good deeds to have done not only enough to be saved
themselves, but to have had a surplus of holiness.
This treasure of sanctity the popes had a right to
dispose of, and could even sell it for money. Thus
arose the horrible sale of indulgences.</p>

<p class='c009'>Baptism and the old confession of faith, or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>three Articles of Faith, remained unchanged; but the
Lord’s Supper had been greatly changed. Laymen
may only eat of the bread, but must not drink of the
wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The popes tyrannized conscience and assumed the
power to release any one from the oath he had sworn.
Whosoever would not submit to the command of the
pope were placed under the ban, that is, they were
in a solemn manner excommunicated from all the
blessings of the Church and surrendered to eternal
damnation.&#8212;The worst of all was, that the people were
prohibited from reading the Bible, so they could not
see how erroneous the doctrines of the Church were
in many respects.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides the regular priesthood, the monks were
also considered servants of the Church. Some of the
monks dwelt alone in secluded places, and were then
called hermits. Others dwelt together in large buildings,
called convents or monasteries. Their superior
is called abbot. The abbot is under the control of the
pope, who thus has the monks in his service. Women
dwelling in convents, and in general subject to the
same rules as the monks, are called nuns. Their
female superior is called abbess. The monks were in
the beginning pious and God-fearing men; besides this
they were industrious, and labored for education.
Later on they became worse, they were indolent and
riotous, and too many of them broke their promise
of chastity. No one else spread so many superstitions
and errors among the people as the monks.</p>

<h3 id='HC6' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>6. The Reformation</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The heresies of the Church were so numerous and
so great that many could not help perceiving them.
But the popes were for many centuries so powerful
that any one who dared to oppose them would fare
badly. John Huss in Bohemia had preached against
the sale of indulgences, and was therefore burned alive
at a great church meeting held in the city of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Constance, even though the emperor had given his word
that he should be permitted to depart in peace from
the meeting. The emperor was informed that he was
under no obligation to keep his word to a heretic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile more and more people began to have
their eyes opened to the condition of the Church.
Education became greater and more extended, for the
art of printing had been invented.</p>

<p class='c009'>About one hundred years after Huss was burned,
Martin Luther stood forth and began that great improvement
in the condition of the Church which is
called The Reformation. Luther was born in 1483, of
poor parents, in the city of Eisleben, Saxony, in the
center of Germany. According to the intention of his
father he was to read law, but on account of his anxiety
for his soul’s salvation he, at the age of twenty-two,
entered a convent and became a monk. Here he
faithfully performed all the requirements of a life in
the convent: prayed, fasted and mortified his flesh;
but he could not find peace for his soul. An old monk
advised him to seek consolation in the old, then almost
forgotten words: I believe in the forgiveness of
sins. These words Luther took to heart, and as he
diligently read the Bible and the writings of the
church fathers<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a>, he at last clearly saw that man is
justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
After Luther had been in a convent for three years,
he was called as teacher to the university at Wittenberg.
Hither came a hawker of indulgences, a monk
named Tetzel, who with the greatest audacity sold
forgiveness of sins for money. At this, Luther was
filled with indignation, and on the 31st of October,
1517, he nailed on the door of the castle church in
Wittenberg ninety-five theses against the sale of indulgences
and other errors. These theses were quickly
circulated throughout Germany, and many pious and
educated men acknowledged that Luther was right.
It was not Luther’s intention to attack the pope, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>he yet believed that the papacy was instituted of God,
and thought that when the pope should be informed
of the true condition of the case, he would grant his
approval of Luther’s act. But they thought differently
in Rome. Luther was placed under the ban of the
Church. In the meantime he had diligently read the
Bible and history, and it was clear to him the papacy
was not instituted of God. He therefore paid no attention
to the ban, but took the bull<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> of the pope and
burned it under an oak outside of the city of Wittenberg.
He was now summoned to appear before
Charles V., emperor of the Roman empire, at the diet
held in the city of Worms, 1521. Many dissuaded him
from going; they reminded him of the fate of
Huss; but Luther answered: If there were as many
devils in Worms as there are tiles on the roofs, yet
would I go. When he came to Worms, he was ushered
into the diet, an assembly where the emperor, the
legate of the pope and many princes and bishops were
gathered. It was demanded that he at once should
recant everything he had taught; but Luther answered:
Unless I am convinced by the Scriptures, or
by clear and binding reasons, I neither can nor will
recant; for it is not advisable to do anything against
conscience. Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise. God
help me! Amen.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was now declared an outlaw, and any one could
with impunity kill him. He was, however, permitted
to leave Worms in peace. But the elector of Saxony,
his prince and protector, caused his own servants to
seize him as he was departing, and had him secretly
carried to the castle of Wartburg. Here he abode
unknown for ten months, and the world believed he
was dead. In this place he began his excellent translation
of the Bible into German, and finished the New
Testament. At the end of that time he returned to
Wittenberg and continued to labor by preaching and
writing. In 1529 he published his Small Catechism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to be used in the instruction of children and youth,
and his Larger Catechism as an aid for the teachers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Luther’s adherents daily became more numerous.
Among them were many princes. At the diet of
Augsburg, in 1530, they laid before the emperor a
confession of their faith, written by the learned and
gentle Philip Melanchthon, and approved by Luther.
In the Augsburg Confession the Lutherans had now
secured a confession, in which they all united. All
who would could now see for themselves that Luther
did not teach a new doctrine, but the old, true Christian
faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Luther died, in 1546, his doctrine was spread
over half of Germany, the whole of Denmark, Norway
and Sweden, and had gained adherents in England,
France and other countries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Contemporaneously with Luther, Ulric Zwingli
stood forth in Switzerland against the sale of indulgences
and other errors. His work was continued by
the Frenchman, John Calvin. Calvin’s adherents are
called Calvinists, or Reformed; they differ from the
Lutherans in the doctrine concerning the Lord’s Supper,
predestination and some other doctrines. The
Reformed confessions are held in Switzerland, Holland,
Scotland, England, and to some extent in France.
Lutherans and Calvinists are called, although historically
improperly, with one common name, Protestants,
in opposition to the adherents of the pope, who are
called Roman Catholics.</p>

<h3 id='HC7' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>7. Reformation Introduced in the North</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>Hans Tausen, a Danish monk, had studied at Wittenberg
and heard Luther. On his return to Denmark
he preached the Evangelical doctrine, and it was
adopted in 1536 as the religion of the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>In about the same manner it went in Sweden. Two
brothers, Olaf and Lars Pehrson, had studied in Wittenberg,
and brought the Evangelical faith home on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>their return. It was in 1544 adopted as the religion of
the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Norway was but poorly prepared for the Reformation.
Education was poor. A German monk named
Anton preached the Evangelical doctrine in Bergen in
1528. His preaching found favor with the citizens,
and the bishop, an indolent man, moved to his residence
outside of the city; but we find no account of
any general awakening. Anton afterwards became
priest in the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>Norway was at that time united to Denmark.
When the Reformation, therefore, was introduced into
that country, it was as a natural consequence established
in Norway, in 1537. At first it found small
favor with the people, who remained Roman Catholic,
and in several places even used violence against the
Evangelical clergy. Little by little, however, the
Evangelical doctrine became better known and found
more favor with the people. This was owing more to
the bishops Geble Pedersen in Bergen, Jens Nilsen
in Oslo and Jørgen Eriksen in Stavanger than to
anybody else. Eriksen has been called “the Luther
of Norway.”</p>

<h3 id='HC8' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>8. The Lutheran Church in the United States of America</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The Lutheran Church was transplanted to North
America in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries by the immigration of Lutherans from
France, Holland, Sweden, Germany, Norway, Denmark,
Iceland, Finland and other lands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lutheran Church in America has always been
in spirit and loyalty, in character and institutions, an
American Church.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to the “Lutheran World Almanac for
1927-1928” there has been a growth in membership
from 900 in 1562 to 4,112,680 in 1927.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The Lutherans of America are divided into 21 general
bodies, as follows: United Lutheran Church, consisting
of 35 constituent synods, 1,311,167 baptized

Wisconsin Synod, 212,558; Slovak Synod, 13,131;
Norwegian Synod, 7,611; Negro Mission of Synodical

<p class='c009'>There are 27 Lutheran <b>Publication Houses</b>, publishing
in 1927 177 papers, having 1,699,385 subscribers;
also 541 new books, 237 reprints, 106 pamphlets,
a total of 3,126,510 copies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of <b>Higher Schools</b> there were 159: Theological
Seminaries, 33, with 180 teachers and 1,637 students;
Colleges, 36, with 779 teachers and 14,203 students;
Junior colleges and academies, 90, with 793 teachers
and 15,813 students;&#8212;a grand total of 1,752 teachers
and 31,653 students, 18,614 boys and 13,039 girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each Synod maintains or supports some <b>Foreign
Mission</b> work, both through its regular Board of Missions
and voluntary agencies, particularly the women’s
federations and young people’s societies. The chief
mission fields are in: China, India, Japan and Kurdistan,
Liberia, South Africa, Tanganyika, Madagascar
and New Guinea; also among Indians of North
and South America, Negroes and Eskimos. 881 missionaries
and 6,727 native workers are engaged in the
foreign fields among a baptized membership of 262,760,
on an annual budget of $2,681,963.00.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <b>Home Mission</b> Boards, with an annual appropriation
of $2,352,125.00 try to gather the unchurched
Lutherans of America into the Church and aim also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>to bring the Gospel to the unchurched neighbors of
every race and color within the United States and
Canada.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work of <b>Charity</b> is pushed in many ways by
Boards, Committees, Societies and Institutions. Of
institutions there are 73 <b>Orphans’ Homes</b>, with 597
employees, caring for 4,700 children; 69 <b>Homes for
the Aged</b>, with 387 employees and 2,499 inmates; 106
<b>Hospitals</b> and Homes for <b>Defectives</b>, with 3,884 employees
and 236,228 patients. There are 11 <b>Deaconess
Homes</b>. The 31 <b>Home Finding Societies</b>, with 100
employees, placed 473 children in homes during 1927.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are also many other activities, congregational,
synodical and intersynodical. One of the chief
intersynodical agencies is the <b>National Lutheran
Council</b>, organized in 1918 to meet emergencies requiring
common action. This Agency has expended
several million dollars during the decennium in relief
and reconstruction work in the countries afflicted by
the World War; also in rescuing the foreign mission
fields affected by the War.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lutheran Church in America emphasizes the
importance of Biblical teaching and preaching and
strict obedience to the Word of God by its members.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Norwegian Lutheran Church of America was
organized on June 9, 1917, by the union of the Hauge
Synod, the Norwegian Synod and the United Norwegian
Lutheran Church of America.</p>

<h3 id='HC9' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>9. Missions. Bible Societies</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>After the Reformation, Christianity has been proclaimed
in far distant lands by missionaries. Hans
Egede, a clergyman in Vaagen, Nordland, Norway,
resigned his charge to go and preach the Gospel in
Greenland. None had gone there with the Word of
God since the Black Death in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1842 the Norwegian Mission Society was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>organized. Schreuder went as its first missionary to
southern Africa. He labored mostly among the Zulus,
among whom he died in 1882. Many followed his example
and went out to heathen nations to bear witness
of Christ. The society later on began missionary
work in the island of Madagascar, where it has established
many large Christian congregations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Norwegian Lutheran Synods in America have
also been engaged in mission work among the heathen,
as follows: the Norwegian Lutheran Church of
America has its field at Hupeh and Honan, China,
with 70 missionaries and 873 native workers; in southeastern
Madagascar, with 31 missionaries and 450
native workers; in Natal including Zululand, South
Africa, with 8 missionaries; among the Indians of
Wisconsin, with 2 missionaries; among the Eskimos
of Alaska, with 3 missionaries. (The figures are for
1927.) The Norwegian Lutheran Free Church has its
fields in southwestern Madagascar and Honan, China;
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (Elling
Synod), among the Indians of Wisconsin; the Lutheran
Synod of the Brethren, in Honan, China. In addition
to these synodical missions, the Norwegian Lutherans
of America have conducted independent missions
among the Jews of Palestine, Russia and the
United States, the Santals of India, the Nestorians of
Chaldea, the Mohammedans of Kurdistan and the
Negroes of the Southern States and the Soudan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both Catholics and Reformed have, during the last
century, been energetic in missionary work. In 1926
about 750 Protestant Missionary Societies were in existence,
carrying on missionary work amongst the
heathen in every part of the world. Four hundred
and fifty of these societies were working in Asia,
200 in Africa, 200 in North America, 110 in South
America, 60 in Australia and the South Sea Islands.</p>

<p class='c009'>The earliest Bible society was the Canstein of
Halle, founded in 1712. The largest Bible society is
the British and Foreign Bible Society, founded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>1804. It has translated the Bible or parts of it into
many languages and dialects, and has distributed
about 400,000,000 Bibles and New Testaments. There
are also other important Bible societies, of which we
shall mention two: the Norwegian Bible Society, organized
in 1816, which has issued about 3,000,000
Bibles and New Testaments; the American Bible Society,
organized in 1816, which has issued over
185,000,000 Bibles and New Testaments. In 1926 the
Bible was translated into 800 languages and dialects.
Of 10 million copies given away in 1926, China alone
got almost 4 million copies.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Gospel has never before been preached in so
many countries as at present, but yet the prophecy is
far from being fulfilled, that there shall be one Flock
and one Shepherd. In 1927 the population of the
world was 1,850,000,000; and of these only 683,000,000
were nominally Christians, while 15,000,000 were
Jews, 209,000,000 were Mohammedans, and 943,000,000
were heathen.</p>

<h3 id='HC10' class='c010'><a href='#TOC-HC'>10. A Brief Sketch of the Holy Land</a></h3>

<p class='c008'>The country known by the names of Canaan, Palestine,
the Holy Land and the Promised Land is located
in Asia, at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea,
and not far from Africa. It is not far from Europe,
and consequently very near the center of that part of
the earth which was known to the ancients. It has
an extent of less than six thousand square miles, being
about one twenty-second part of the size of the kingdom
of Norway. It has now about three hundred and
fifty thousand inhabitants, but had formerly a great
many more. When King David numbered the people,
he found one million three hundred thousand who
could bear arms. One-fourth of a population is generally
considered able to bear arms, and the number
of inhabitants at that time must have exceeded five
millions.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>The country is very mountainous. To the north,
in Syria, is Mount Lebanon, ten thousand feet at its
highest, and east of this is Mount Hermon. Lebanon
was famed for its magnificent cedars. From Lebanon
and Hermon two mountain ranges extend southward
through the whole length of the country, one to the
west, the other to the east of the river Jordan. Jerusalem
lies two thousand five hundred feet above the
ocean. The river Jordan runs two hundred miles from
north to south, and divides the country into two parts.
It flows through the Lake of Gennesaret, which has
been and is yet very rich in fish, and empties into
the Dead Sea, which is forty-five miles long and ten
miles wide. The Dead Sea lies thirteen hundred feet
lower than the Mediterranean Sea. The water has a
bitter taste and is very salty. Neither animal nor
vegetable life can exist in it. If a fish happens to stray
from the Jordan into the lake, it dies. Such is now
the condition of that plain which once upon a time was
as the garden of Eden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Palestine lies far south; its summers are therefore
hot, and the winters mild. In Jerusalem, which lies
at such great altitude, snow may occasionally fall in
January and February, but melts immediately.&#8212;The
land used to be very fruitful, producing grain, wine,
many kinds of fruit, and had good pastures. In the
Bible it is called “a land flowing with milk and honey.”
Now it is entirely different. The country has through
many centuries been badly governed, and the saying
appears to be true that where the Turk sets his foot,
grass will grow no more.&#8212;Of forests may be mentioned
the Woods of Ephraim, where Joab slew Absalom.
The cedar wood, with which Solomon ceiled the
temple, came from Lebanon.&#8212;The camel was a beast
of burden, and used mostly in traveling.&#8212;Of wild animals
there were lions and bears, as we read in the
stories of Samson and David.</p>

<p class='c009'>The country was at first divided into twelve parts
among the twelve tribes. Later on it was divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>into the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. At the time
of our Savior it was divided into four parts: Judæa,
Samaria, Galilee and Perea. Judæa was the southern,
Samaria the middle, Galilee the northern part west
of the Jordan river; while Perea was east of the Jordan.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
